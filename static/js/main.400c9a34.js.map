}];\r\n\r\nlet paragraphs = `\r\n中秋圓夜，夜闌人靜。東晉孝宗永和五年的蜀地，縱然於六街三市，萬籟之音仍顯得格外清晰。似乎整座城郊，盡隨著唧唧之聲沉沉睡去。唯獨一坐落在龍門山山腳處的唐家莊，張燈結彩，人聲鼎沸，和空寂的月色，成了強烈對比。\r\n周旋在燈火通明的大廳上，七八個士紳與眾多門客，在高級紅木桌椅上飲酒作樂，身旁圍繞著歌妓和丫鬟，空氣中彌漫著酒香與濃濃的胭脂味。這味兒便是來自作客的官家大小姐，曲嫣。\r\n\r\n只見她濃妝豔抹，嬌媚動人，又值妙齡，瞧得在場人們，無一不為之神魂顛倒。雖然此時和大家齊身坐在紅木桌椅上，但她的心早飄向昏暗、寂靜的一方。沉默許久，她起身轉向走廊的一端，望昏暗的樓梯間，姍姍而行。\r\n\r\n同屬於大戶人家，二樓卻格外黯然岑寂。從樓梯間傳來的歡笑聲，使二樓顯得更加落寞悽涼。慘淡的月色潑灑在陽台上，映出了一旁桂花樹與九重葛的輪廓，和一幢長長的人影，也為輕聲的嘆息增添了無數愁思。\r\n那嘆息之人，喚作宋天映，年近而立，生得丰姿英偉，相貌軒昂。他眉頭深鎖，憑欄沈思，滿腹心事地凝視著對面樓閣中彈古箏的女子，但聽那琴聲悠揚，卻在音符之中夾雜淡淡的哀愁，聽著聽著，不由得痴了。\r\n\r\n待有意識時，身旁已多了一人，卻是那位官家大小姐。月光照射下，只見她淚光閃動，如帶雨的梨花，嬌柔欲墜。兩人默然無語，惟有痴痴望著那輪滿月，高掛中天。\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n此時已近三更時分，書房之內紅燭高燒，人影顫動。宋天映在窗邊來回踱步，思念之間，門呀地一聲打開。曲嫣手捧熱茶，玉步而入，將茶碗輕放在几席上，淡淡道了聲：「官人請用茶。」轉身離去。\r\n\r\n宋天映愣愣望著她的背影，隱隱覺得這女子神色間帶著一股無法抑制的哀傷。不知是為情所困，還是有志難伸？\r\n几上熱茶香氣四溢，宋天映嗅了嗅，卻捨不得喝。 遠遠傳來的琴聲縈繞耳際，似嘆息，似呻吟，琴心相挑，百般柔情蜜意飄忽其間。他閉上眼睛，深深吸一口氣，將一封短信放入懷中，手端茶杯，踏出了書房。\r\n他放輕腳步，繞過多人走過的路段，悄聲步向迴廊的另一端，而纏綿宛轉的琴聲不時在心頭盪漾。\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n小小朱閣之中，燈光脈脈，琴聲縈繞，纖纖巧手，撥弄琴弦。這彈琴的女子，眉似春山，眼若秋水，鬒髮如雲，傾瀉而下。\r\n\r\n但見她眉梢輕皺，滿腹心事，向誰傾訴？ 只得藉這古箏與手指，奏出她無盡心酸。\r\n她望著窗外溶溶月色，琴聲由悲悽漸轉溫柔，思緒墜入了回憶之中：\r\n\r\n「我姓景，單名一個涵字。生於豫州世族大家，從小生活富足優渥，閒來讀些經史子集，偶爾跟著家中武師學些武藝。十九歲前，一直過得悠閒愜意。直到那年，兩地貴族聯姻，把我嫁到了蜀地唐家莊，關在這華麗卻寂寞的樓閣之中。\r\n\r\n唐家莊莊主唐易是個好色之徒，三番兩次進來房中，想侮辱於我，都因我極力反抗而作罷。我總想著要離開這裡，但若離開了，卻又何去何從？思索多日，仍沒有答案，我愈想愈傷心，一時衝動，竟選擇了自盡這條路。\r\n\r\n「那一日晚上，天上也是掛著一輪溶溶滿月。我站在高几兒上，擦乾淚水，將吊在梁柱上的白布帶纏在頸中，待要把高几踢去，房門突然間被撞了開來。定神一看，竟是個男子，渾身是血，進了房間便倒地不起。\r\n我探他鼻息，呼吸微弱，於是趕忙將他抱到床上，想替他止血。卻聽走廊外面急促的腳步聲，只得迎上門口。但見外頭來了三個士兵，向我厲聲問道：『有人來過這裡麼？』我指著走廊另一端道：『我剛才看見一人，慌慌張張地往那裡逃去了，卻不知為甚麼？』那三個士兵不答腔，頭也不回的走了。\r\n\r\n我關上門，趕緊回到床邊，拿起丹藥替那人止血。唐易那壞人嫉賢妒才，近日追捕那些見解與他相左的正義之人，許多志士慌忙逃竄，這人想必也是其中之一。\r\n我陪在他旁邊守了一整晚，也不知何時打起盹來，醒來時，卻見那人側著身子，呆呆望著我。我頓時羞紅了臉，低下頭來。忽聽他有氣無力地說道：『多謝姑娘相救。』我點頭相應，接著又是一陣沈默。\r\n\r\n待又修養數天，他才向我說明來歷。原來他是唐家莊的一位謀士，叫做宋天映，輔佐前莊主多年，統領整個唐家莊。那時的唐家莊，秉持著經世濟民的理念，順服於晉國，支持桓溫桓大將軍北伐，以衛漢民族之天下。可是前莊主逝世後，其子唐易即位，率領了一批新的勢力，叛離晉國，鏟除過去父親身邊的謀士。而前幾日的殺戮，便是那剷除計劃的其中一環。\r\n\r\n「我聽完後擔心道：『那你養完傷後快點走罷！』 他搖頭道：『我答應了前莊主，不管他生前死後，都要輔佐莊主，帶領唐家莊扶危持顛，匡救時局，以解民與倒懸之苦。現下情況，我只得說服莊主把我留下，但願唐家莊有挽救的可能。』\r\n\r\n「此後一日，他的傷勢漸癒，離開樓閣，輔佐莊主去了。每隔兩三天，他總會回來找我，有時還帶些珠寶首飾、精緻點心，那時候，我已經沒有逃脫的意念了。直到不久前，他說唐家莊的有為志士已蕩然無存，回到過去唐家莊的理念也不過是鏡花水月。他的行跡已被懷疑，為了我和他的安全，不能常常見我。從他的眼神，可以看出百般的愧疚與無奈。他牽起我的手，溫言道：『寡固不可以敵眾，唐家莊已不再是久留之地，這幾日我聯絡上桓大將軍的部署，日後你和我一同投奔桓將軍門下罷。』 那是他最後一次來找我了。」思念及此，景涵輕輕嘆了口氣。\r\n\r\n忽聽得咚咚兩聲，卻是有人敲門。景涵愣半晌，見著前方之人，登時臉泛紅暈，嬌羞無限。那便是她朝思暮想的意中人，宋天映。\r\n\r\n宋天映微微一笑，神色十分溫和，卻帶著幾分歉意。他將茶放在一旁的高几上，過去坐在景涵身旁，景涵抿嘴一笑，將頭輕輕倚在他懷裡，他則溫柔地輕撫她的頭。纏綿多時，外頭傳來碰地一陣關門聲，從水晶簾望去，只見對面樓閣微亮，數個人影集聚房內，似在談論要事。宋天映直身坐起，不覺憂慮起來，景涵輕聲相詢。\r\n\r\n宋天映問道：「涵兒識得伍子胥麼？」 景涵道：「伍子胥？是春秋末期的吳國大夫麼？」宋天映點頭道：「我曾聽聞將近一個月之前，有幾個崆峒武人在吐谷渾一帶掘到一卷戰國帛書，帛書裡頭標示了伍子胥墓的所在與內部結構。相傳吳王夫差逼伍子胥自盡，將屍體丟入錢塘江後，其故里官宦、士紳、鄉親替他築墓。為防盜墓，共築一百座墳，九十九座假墳在河西，真墳埋在河東江津一地，並修有一廟。這伍子胥是著名的軍事家、謀略家。他的墓中不乏金銀珠寶，卻也不乏兵書武譜和治國經典。現下時局動盪，民不聊生，若能尋得那些治國良策以匡救時事，豈不是美事一件？\r\n\r\n「桓將軍好不容易在永和二年平定蜀地，不過三年，唐易便有心帶領蜀地叛晉。那幾個崆峒武人下落不明，而唐易與他的謀士們又對著那帛書打鬼主意，若給他碰上那群武人，奪去帛書，蜀地叛晉，只怕計日可俟了。」\r\n\r\n宋天映輕嘆一聲，說道：「事不宜遲。你先收拾好東西，我們明日子時就起程。」從懷中取出一封短信遞與景涵道：「這是桓將軍部署差信使送來的。我們只要到了距唐家莊三十里外的見心湖畔，對方會派人馬接應，這樣對你也會比較安全。」景涵握著宋天映的手柔聲道：「你自己也要小心一點。」\r\n\r\n一會兒，急促的腳步聲從對面走廊傳來。從窗外望去，卻見曲嫣慌張地打開宋天映的房門，不見人影，臉色更加慘白。\r\n\r\n宋天映扶著景涵站起，說道：「不知發生什麼事，我這就去看看。你先在這兒等著，我待會兒回來找你。」\r\n景涵站在原地，望著宋天映離去的身影。忽瞥見高几兒上的茶，聞得淡淡茗香，捧起茶杯啜飲一口，緩步回床邊。\r\n\r\n忽然身後一冰冷的聲音道：「兩人見面就卿卿我我的，也不知有旁人在場。這事若給其他人知曉了，你們還能活著離開麼？」\r\n\r\n景涵從床上跳起，吃了一驚，道：「誰？」 一陣風襲來，吹動了水晶簾，瞥向窗口，卻不見人影。\r\n\r\n驀地，背後傳來一聲冷笑。景涵回頭一看，見是一個二十來歲的男子，頭戴華陽巾，身披錦繡衣，手持白羽扇，卻是個瀟灑風流雅士。景涵愣道：「是你？」 原來這人是揚州世族豪門的公子哥，人稱凌公子。\r\n\r\n景涵擋在門口，怒道：「你想做甚麼？」 凌公子訕笑道：「沒事沒事，不過來拿個東西，何需勞動姑娘大駕？快回去坐好罷。」右手拈起一封短信，側頭瞧了瞧，放入懷中。\r\n\r\n景涵阿地一聲，見凌公子拿走桓將軍捎來的密信，嚇得冷汗直流，顫聲道：「要…要怎麼樣你才肯還我？」 凌公子道：「說了你也不信，捉得到我再告訴你罷！」轉身望窗戶，縱身一躍，消失在一片黑暗中。\r\n\r\n景涵心中慌亂異常，也不思索，立時奪窗而出，緊跟著前方的颯颯風聲，在屋脊之上疾身騰躍，腳下毫不停緩。至最外圍一片屋緣，縱身而下，藉著一旁屋檐欄柱，減緩了下墜之勢。眼見下方一片空地，零零散散站幾個守夜人。\r\n凌公子喊道：「讓開讓開，爺爺悶著，那個敢擋路的，你爺爺一人一腳，通通點翻！」那幾人也當真懼怕凌公子，沒頭沒尾地慌忙逃竄。凌公子將騎馬之人攔下，騰身上馬，又將另一個馬主踢下馬背，先自走了。景涵從後趕上，騎了另一匹馬追去。\r\n\r\n兩匹健馬腳不點地向前疾馳，直入樹林，穿枝拂葉，來到大片荒野之中。 凌公子一扯馬韁，速度慢了下來。景涵縱馬從後迎上，伸手朝他捉去。凌公子忽地一個翻身，閃到了馬腹一側，只教景涵這招抓了個空。景涵雙腳一蹬，從馬背上躍起，空中一記旋風腿望凌公子胸口踢去。凌公子的武功自也不弱，他不貿然進攻，但見招拆招，所有拳法都被輕鬆擋下了。\r\n\r\n當景涵不知所措之際，忽聽凌公子說道：「你和宋天映投靠桓溫，為甚麼不算我一份？」景涵一愣，呆望著凌公子，不敢相信適才所聽到的。凌公子不理，逕自走去荒煙漫草中的一座孤墳後方，提出一顆血淋淋的人頭拋在地上。景涵大吃一驚，認得是唐易身邊，一位姓彭的親信。\r\n\r\n凌公子道：「幾日前，傳遞桓將軍書信的使者剛來到龍門山山腳，便被這王八逮個正著，告了密，把那使者殺了。爾後傳信給宋天映的使者，卻是莊裡食客扮的。我在一旁瞧得清清楚楚，而你們卻渾然不知。若不是我花費心思，好意提醒，你和你那情郎，只怕沒能再多活幾天。」景涵面色慘白道：「你…你素來和唐易姣好，為甚麼願意幫我們，還要投靠桓大將軍門下？」凌公子呸地一聲道:「你甚麼時候見我跟他姣好了！ 我是為了帛書才來這裡的。此書內容你已知曉，而我是來取書獻與將軍的。」 景涵低頭不語。\r\n\r\n凌公子望著景涵，只見她的面龐在月光照射下，隱隱泛著一股青氣，心頭登時一震，問道：「你身體還好麼？」 景涵打了個寒顫道：「沒甚麼，只覺外頭有些冷。」 凌公子聽了臉色大變，擔心道：「你是不是中毒了？」\r\n\r\n啪噠噠…啪噠噠…\r\n\r\n只聽遠處達達馬蹄聲，隱隱傳來，甚是急驟。凌公子攜著景涵躲在孤墳後方。待他定眼凝視，雙馬已至眼前，騎在上面的各是兩條大漢。兵刀相交，雙劍急如閃電，鬥得十分激烈。\r\n\r\n只聽一留著山羊鬍的大漢罵道：「媽八羔子，一個膿包還跟人搶什麼帛書！老子他媽的先在你身上刺一百個透明窟窿再說！」持劍望另一人臉上扎出。 那沒鬍子的回刀一架，叫道：「放你娘的狗屁！你要帛書，根本是癩蝦膜想吃天鵝屁。滾回家撒泡尿照照自己那副鳥臉罷！ 」 兩人一攻一守，鬥了許久。躲在墳後的景涵，忽覺胸口疼痛欲裂，不由得輕輕阿了一聲。\r\n\r\n驀地，雜草四散，刀光閃閃。那兩大漢聽得人聲，竟一同攻來！\r\n\r\n凌公子抽出長劍，使了一記掃刀側空翻，轉身一道回旋，將敵人刀劍架去，順勢斜劈。但聽啊地一聲，兩個大漢都被砍中。荒野之中，劍光交閃，飛舞上下，凌公子的劍好似帶有黏性一般，只輕輕用尖端望敵人刀劍一拂，兵器登時脫手而出。 凌公子不待喘息之機，一招掃腿連著騰空飛腳相繼而出，只踢得兩大漢站立不住，各往兩側翻了出去。那鬍子大漢惱怒異常，挺起身子，一鼓作氣，往凌公子身上猛撲。凌公子一矮身形，一手抓那大漢左腕，另一手扣住腦門，猛轉一圈，只聽得殺豬般的大叫，那鬍子大漢已被拋出數丈之外。\r\n\r\n凌公子舉步如飛，擒住另一大漢，持長劍抵住脖子，問道：「你們兩個膿包可知道帛書的下落？」\r\n那沒鬍子的大漢嚇得魂不附體，結結巴巴道：「這…這也是聽說的…我只道那幾個失蹤的崆峒武人，最近跋山涉水，來到蜀地，現在…可能就在龍門山，唐家莊附近…」\r\n\r\n凌公子吃驚半晌，問道：「那些人長甚麼樣子？一共幾人？」那大漢道：「求求大人饒命，這我也不知道啊！」凌公子道：「諒你也不敢說謊，否則先刺你幾個窟窿！」一手把他推開。那大漢在草地上滾了一圈，跌跌撞撞，沒命似地逃了。\r\n\r\n凌公子沉默一會兒，見景涵已昏厥在草叢之中。四周寂靜無聲，荒野孤寂蕭條，忽聞風聲隆隆，林間窸窣作響，凌公子攜著景涵，策馬狂奔，隱沒在漆黑的樹林中。\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n卻說初在朱閣，原本沉浸在綿綿情意中的宋天映，望見曲嫣驚恐的模樣，立知發生情急之事，只得依依站起，迅速出了門外。\r\n\r\n途經通往對面樓閣的走廊間，卻被兩個留守的士兵發現，宋天映趕忙轉身往樓梯間奔去。不料樓梯轉角又有兩個士兵擋住了去路，其中一人用長矛尖端抵住他的喉頸，後方的兩士兵也追了過來。\r\n\r\n宋天映驚怒交集，料知行蹤已曝，不禁顧慮起景涵的安危。才一失神，已被身後士兵捏住後頸，壓倒在地，頸部順著長矛撫過處，劃破一道鮮血。那士兵右腳跟著提起，直向他腎俞穴踹去。\r\n\r\n宋天映冷然一笑，驀地左手一翻，只聽喀一聲響，對方左腕已被扭斷。那士兵勃然大怒，口裡祖宗十八代地亂嚷，舉起右手，朝宋天映的天靈蓋直劈下去。 宋天映急急一個翻身，只把士兵滾倒在地。那士兵煞不住手，凝氣聚力，直望地板劈去，砰一聲，痛得哇哇大叫。\r\n\r\n其餘三個士兵見狀，都拿起長矛一併攻來。宋天映拔劍在身，使了一招「風捲殘雲」，劍刃顫動，嗡嗡有聲，登時將三個士兵籠罩在劍光之中，三隻長矛瞬間劈成兩半。 宋天映嘿嘿一聲，望三人屁股，一人一腳，朝著樓梯踢將下去。\r\n\r\n不過一會兒，只聞得樓梯高處，隱隱傳來腳步聲，相較於那些士兵，卻是輕盈得多。 宋天映恐怕是唐易身邊，功力更高一層的部屬，趕忙翻出窗外，沿著牆柱，躍到對面樓房的長廊中。\r\n\r\n曲嫣在樓梯間左顧右盼，心裡頭焦躁不安，思忖道：「剛才的打鬥聲明是從這兒傳來，怎麼現在半個人也沒有？」 把頭探出窗戶外邊張望，忽然頸部一陣酸麻，跌坐在地，任她怎麼掙扎，全身竟是不得動彈。但曲嫣卻不緊張，亦不嗔怒，唯有愣愣地望著昏暗的樓梯間。四周寂靜無聲，想起悲傷的往事，不禁淚如泉湧。\r\n\r\n銀河耿耿，皓月當空，曲嫣停止啜泣，望著夜幕繁星點點，哽咽道：「爹爹，孩兒不想待在這裡了。讓孩兒上去陪你，好嗎？」幾道淡淡淚痕劃過她的臉龐。\r\n\r\n隱隱約約，有一模糊的身影在眼前晃動，逐漸逼近。依稀可見，是個高瘦的男子。曲嫣嘴角上揚，期盼道：「是…是爹爹嗎？」 等了許久，卻沒聽到答覆，只覺酸麻之感瞬間消失。她抹去淚水，見前方的人是宋天映，慘然一笑，淡淡道：「謝了。」\r\n\r\n宋天映問道：「適才誰點了你的穴道？」曲嫣聳聳肩，木然仰望星空，突然想起一事，驀地站起，緊張道：「宋官人，那杯茶你喝了麼？」宋天映見曲嫣臉色不對，立時會意，一個踉蹌，險些坐倒，顫聲道：「涵…涵兒…」\r\n\r\n曲嫣面色慘白，歉然道：「唐易請我送茶給你，卻不知他事前摻了毒藥，真的很對不起。」 宋天映搖了搖手，不願多說，一個轉身消失在樓梯間，曲嫣跟著慌然追去。\r\n\r\n兩人來到朱閣幽房，房內無人，高几兒上的茶已少半。曲嫣嘆了一口氣，試圖安慰宋天映，但話到了嘴邊卻講不出來，見宋天映面如土色，動也不動，神色十分可怖，不禁打了個寒顫。\r\n\r\n忽然背後傳來一聲冷笑，回身察看，卻是唐易。只聽他說道：「宋謀士，大難臨頭，還來私會你的小情人是麼？」 宋天映怒道：「唐莊主，宋天映在此，要剁要殺，是你我兩人之事。暗中下藥，傷及無辜，未免太不光明。」\r\n\r\n唐易愣了一下，望著半杯茶水，頓時了然，嘿嘿笑道：「她死了麼？那婆娘早該殺了。不想這次無心插柳，借情郎之手，殺那不忠不敬的淫婦，倒免了玷污我這口寶刀。」\r\n\r\n宋天映拔劍在身，氣得只想一個箭步上前，把唐易刺死在地。\r\n\r\n唐易道：「宋謀士，你這幾個月來做的事情，瞞得了莊客，瞞得了謀士，卻瞞不了本莊主。本莊主素來反對與晉議和，宋謀士改變不了唐家莊，便想投靠桓將軍，洩露機密，好讓晉軍輕而易舉地收拾唐家莊。我說的話不錯罷？」\r\n\r\n唐家莊之所以能在蜀地有舉足輕重的地位，有大半部份是來自宋天映的功勞。他自不希望見到唐家莊為晉軍所滅。然現任莊主暴虐無道，唐家莊日漸失去威信，蜀民怨聲載道。若非以晉軍之力擊敗莊主，還有甚麼辦法呢？ 宋天映思念及此，一時之間竟答不上話。\r\n\r\n唐易向身後兩個大漢使了眼神，從腰間抽出一口寶刀，似笑非笑道：「宋謀士，上劍！」\r\n\r\n宋天映愣了一下，忽地大喝一聲，挺劍上前，砍削斬劈，一口氣連攻十招，唐易在劍風之中縱橫來去，始終沒有反擊。待他第十一招劍身朝下之時，忽然舉刀猛劈，宋天映忽覺手腕沈了下去。這一招雖然刀法平平，勢道卻剛猛異常，不過連砍三刀，長劍已然脫手。\r\n\r\n宋天映心中一凜，只聽唐易道：「來來，咱們拳腳論高下！」 說時遲，那時快，才說了個拳字，右掌倏地揮出。宋天映閃避不及，兩手硬接。只覺對方掌力強勁，不由得退後好幾步，胸口隱隱作痛。\r\n\r\n宋天映心中憤怒異常，一招「火龍滾」向唐易劈去。唐易側身閃避，一掌從肩頭擦過，接著反手又是一招，越打越急，越鬥越險，各個招法快絕無倫。唐易使出的招數愈盡狠辣，似乎非置宋天映於死地，突然大喝一聲，橫身一躍，「直斬龍門」直劈而出，用了十足力量，宋天映也不退避，右手一轉，使盡全力，向前擊去，兩掌相交，砰然巨響，兩人都被震得站立不住。唐易退了兩步，宋天映卻向後跌了出去，撞上曲嫣。\r\n\r\n這時，曲嫣早與兩大漢拆了數十招。兩大漢的武藝平平，但身型龐大又以二敵一，曲嫣只能勉強支撐。不想宋天映突然撞了上來，一個分神，其中一大漢趁機一拳揮出，直中腹部。\r\n\r\n曲嫣跌坐在地，直瞪兩大漢，臉露殺機，騰地起身往前疾衝。那大漢自恃高大，竟不閃避，雙手護胸，欲與她來個硬碰硬，不料曲嫣到了面前竟然縮身，從腳下穿了出去，縱身躍起，抽出一把寒玉冰刀。刀刃出鞘，四周忽變得寒冷異常，刀身在燭光照射下，閃出幽藍的光影。曲嫣瞬時揮出，望著兩人劈頭便砍。咕咚一聲，兩個漢子已然身首異處。\r\n\r\n曲嫣往門邊一看，見唐易和宋天映又鬥了起來。僵持許久，忽見唐易衣袖裡面閃過一卷素色物事，大吃一驚，把手伸入懷中，竟空無一物。她顫抖著手，指向唐易，驚叫道：「你…你竟然偷了我爹爹的帛書！」\r\n\r\n宋天映心中詫然：「她爹爹的帛書？難道她就是崆峒武人之一？」 才一恍神，胸口便中了唐易用勁十足的一掌，仰身倒地。不一會兒，只覺胸口灼熱，緊接而來一陣刺痛，如上百枚金針刺入皮膚。他忙扯開衣袖，見胸口隱隱有一層黑氣。這一掌非同小可，竟是出了名的狠招「毒砂掌」。\r\n\r\n曲嫣乍見此招，往事斗然湧上心頭，臉色慘白，指著唐易道：「原來就是你！」 唐易道：「帛書在此，現在知道，也為時已晚了，嘿嘿！」\r\n\r\n原來在近一個月前，五位崆峒五人，包括曲氏父女和三個練武弟兄，路經吐谷渾，在荒漠一座岩洞內掘到一卷戰國帛書。五人打開一看，發現不得了，裡面竟繪出了寶藏武譜的所在，於是都興高采烈地要來中原尋寶。然而這幾人一路上各個心懷鬼胎，才來到與藏寶之處仍有千里之遙的蜀地，竟動起手來，自相殘殺，最後由曲氏父女奪得帛書。\r\n\r\n不料來到劍門蜀道，又遭近十個黑衣人埋伏。兩人擊退八九個黑衣人後，都是筋疲力竭，只剩下一個武功較高之人。曲老漢吃了這一仗後自知老命休矣，想後悔也為時已晚，向曲嫣道：「老子曾說過，芸芸眾生，生生死死，而不能得道上昇者，都是因一個『貪』字而起。貪求身外的有形萬物，不管得到與否，皆是大傷神氣，以致流浪生死，常沈於苦海之中，受苦受難。這卷帛書造成了崆峒武人之間的鬩牆，爹爹只求我唯一的女兒能夠好好活著，將此帛書送給將來要成大事之人，造福天下蒼生。」曲老漢將帛書遞給曲嫣，上前與那黑衣人鬥了起來。兩人拆了數招，卻見曲老漢胸口中掌，嘔出一口血，摔倒在地，動也不動，看似死了。那黑衣人正得意，蹲下身來便翻他衣袋，想找帛書。忽然曲老漢伸手抓住黑衣人，兩人在地翻滾扭打，一不注意，竟然翻身下崖！\r\n\r\n想到此處，曲嫣已是淚涕縱橫，全身癱軟。想當時自己孤身一人，又飢又渴，聽說蜀地唐家莊集賢納士，於是慕名而來，卻不知自己原來到了虎穴。曲嫣一肚子火氣，那料黑衣人竟然未死，恨不得立刻殺了他，一報殺父之仇！\r\n\r\n不知哪來的力氣，曲嫣突然橫身一躍，使了一套「奪命拳」猛擊唐易。唐易大吃一驚，見此套路來勢凌厲，不留活路，竟是難以硬擋，急著閃身相避。見曲嫣拔出寒玉冰刀揮來，他忙抽出七星刀相抵，兩刀相交，火花四濺，唐易暗暗心驚。曲嫣舉刀急砍猛斫，招招指向唐易各處死穴，而宋天映的劍也從背後襲來，自己只有防守的分。\r\n\r\n唐易見不是對頭，忙賣了個破綻，跳出圈外。一聲呼嘯，門外數十個士兵登時湧入，把宋天映和曲嫣包圍在內。兩人拚鬥多時，終究寡不敵眾，宋天映也因此毒發更快，只覺一陣暈眩，當場撲倒在地，昏死過去。好幾個士兵見機不可失，刀劍鎗棍一併戳來！\r\n\r\n突然間房內嗡嗡作響，數十把飛刀破窗而入，好幾名士兵都被戳翻在地。眾人驚愕間，只見一書生打扮的青年，抱著一個身虛體弱的女子，從窗戶躍將近來。卻是凌公子與景涵。\r\n\r\n唐易乾笑一聲，說道：「好精準的身手。凌兄想必也是來取帛書的罷？」凌公子道：「唐兄料事如神。在下向來不愛管事，但為了帛書和桓將軍的擁護者，不想管也得管了。」唐易道：「凌兄的意思是？」凌公子指著景涵道：「還請唐兄另賜解藥。」\r\n\r\n唐易道：「那杯茶早是為了讓中毒之人必死無疑，所以摻入的毒並沒有解藥。這婆娘死不死也只是早晚的問題。」此時景涵已悠悠醒轉，聽了唐易一言，心中涼了大半。 凌公子愣了半晌，說道：「此話當真？」唐易道：「凌兄可曾聽本莊主有過半句虛言？」凌公子心想此話不錯，一時間默然不語。\r\n\r\n只見景涵起身，幽幽地道：「唐莊主，容我和你來一場比試，在刀劍上分高下。」唐易道：「輸了便怎樣？」景涵道：「我若輸了，任憑你處置；你若輸了，立刻歸還帛書，放大夥離開。」\r\n\r\n唐易嘿嘿一笑，心想你這娘兒死到臨頭還敢跟老子比試。老子恐怕只消兩三招，不待你毒性發作，馬上置你於死地。當下也不說大話，抽出寶刀站在房中央，說道：「來罷！」將刀一晃，欲待進招，景涵的長劍已劈頭刺到。唐易連忙側頭，又驚又怒，想道若不是老子閃得快，這顆頭豈不是要給她劈成兩半？ 當下邁開腳步，將自己最為得意的唐家刀法施展出來。但見刀光閃閃，劍影飛旋，兩人聚精會神，互不相讓，越打越烈。\r\n\r\n拚鬥多時，唐易見景涵如此倔強，不由得不耐煩起來，心想這番鬥得沒完沒了，怎還有力氣去收拾另外三個反賊？ 接連使出的刀法愈是很辣，盡是殺機。 他卻沒料到，景涵此時心裡所想的，便是：「左右是個死，倒不如與敵人同歸於盡！」\r\n\r\n時間一久，景涵體力逐漸不支，面對唐易的刀法也愈漸不敵。唐易看在眼裡，心裡冷笑，提步上前，突然大喝一聲，刀鋒一轉，往她腹中刺去。不料景涵不閃不架，反而撲身向前。但見刀鋒沒入腹中，景涵同時舉劍望唐易頸中一抹。唐易做夢也想不到會發生這等事，寶刀還不及拔出，頸中的血卻先濺了出來。他低吼一聲，拔出寶刀，使盡最後一股力氣，直狠狠地望景涵脖頸，橫劈而去。\r\n\r\n景涵受傷甚重，彎刀揮來時，竟無力閃避，當下心中一寒。霎時間，卻見唐易死瞪雙眼，寶刀停落半空，全身僵直如木。景涵正自錯愕，忽見唐易似樹木一般，直挺挺地倒下，磅地一聲，氣絕在地，後心插著一把凌公子的飛刀，刀身沒入直至刀柄。\r\n\r\n正所謂樹倒猢猻散，那些僥倖活命的士兵，見莊主被殺，都如無頭蒼蠅般慌忙逃去了。凌公子和曲嫣抱起景涵到床上躺下，但見她氣若游絲，面無血色。掙扎許久，才無力地問道：「宋大哥怎樣了？」凌公子道：「為了提防唐易的毒砂掌，我身邊早備有解藥。宋天映不會有事的。」 景涵安然一笑，闔上雙眼。 凌公子和曲焉靜靜目送景涵含笑而逝。\r\n\r\n良久，曲嫣將帛書遞與凌公子，說道：「這帛書給你，希望桓將軍之後能夠成就大業，讓人民過更好的日子。」她慘然一笑，轉身望窗外，飄然而去。凌公子呆愣半晌，道：「你不跟我們一起走麼？」站起身來，跟著追出窗外。\r\n\r\n過了一盞茶時分，宋天映漸漸醒轉，見原本雕闌玉砌、富麗堂皇的玉門豪房，經一場惡鬥變得慘不忍睹、凌亂不堪，不禁慨然長嘆。忽瞥見床上躺著一人，仔細一看，卻不是景涵是誰？ 他湊身過去，見她臉色慘白，渾身僵硬，顯是死去多時。宋天映簡直不敢相信自己的眼睛，望著她的笑容，忽然悲從中來，伏在景涵身上失聲痛哭…\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n曉月墜，宿雲微，又是一天的開始。宋天映獨步後園，凝視著一座小小石墳，暗自嘆氣。\r\n\r\n晨風拂來，他不覺打了個寒顫。龍門山的晨間孤寂蕭條，恰和自己的心相輝映。萬物會隨著太陽的升起而再度甦醒，然而，自己心中的那顆太陽呢？ 思念及此，原本泛紅的眼眶，更盈滿了淚珠。\r\n\r\n忽聽得身後一人說道：「準備好了麼？」 宋天映擦乾淚水，回過身來，卻是凌公子，牽著兩匹駿馬。\r\n\r\n宋天映道：「曲嫣不跟我們走麼？」 凌公子道：「曲嫣只怕已不在塵世。」他頓了一下，道：「昨日在荒山野地中，途經一座寺院，她進去之後，便不再出來了。」兩人沈默，久久不語。\r\n\r\n好一會兒，凌公子才黯然道：「昨天晚上真的很遺憾。」 宋天映望著石墳，淡淡說道：「昨夜沈睡時，我夢見了一季的花落。那花兒容姿絕麗，嬌美不可玩物。只可惜凋零之後，便不復綻放了。」\r\n凌公子微微苦笑，從懷裡掏出帛書看了看，道：「我們走罷。」\r\n\r\n兩人躍上馬背，迎著東升的陽光達達而行。宋天映掉落在石墳上的淚珠，反射著旭日光芒，化作縷縷晴絲，消失在無邊無際的遠方。\r\n\r\n------------------ END

話說福州東南一側有座南山，其山勢崎嶇，嵬嶷嶢屼。時見筆峰挺立，曲澗深沈。偶有白練般的流水倒掛其間，形成瀑布，雪浪紛飛，雲霧終年繚繞其間，因此傳為仙人聚集修道之所。又其山型如鳳凰展翼，故亦名為鳳凰山。\r\n\r\n  鳳凰山中有座古廟，廟內供的神像藍藍綠綠，各個橫眉豎目、瞪眼獰笑，做手舞足道之狀，大大小小加起來一共百來個。此廟所在山頭道路險阻，人跡少至，經歷了幾十年光景，更因年久失修，而致廟宇破廢，神像毀壞。山下居民更說此地常有怪風，每當三五之夜，便會看見幽幽的藍火在樹林間飄忽，聽見似人非人的怒吼咆哮之聲在山谷間回盪，因此紛紛傳說此地鬧鬼。\r\n\r\n  卻說鳳凰山腳下有間鹿鳴書院，班有十人，裡頭有位韓生，年約弱冠，長得白白淨淨，貌似姑娘，又因其生性膽小，同窗們都戲稱他「兔兒郎」。一日，韓生如往常至書院，尋了自家桌椅，坐身解開行囊，想取書預習。不料才剛解出了個小縫，裡頭忽然鑽出一條青蛇，迫不及待地想要破囊而出。韓生驚叫一聲，騰地從椅上躍起，右手一揮，連囊帶蛇，滾溜溜地飛出窗外。韓生驚魂未定，後退一步，竟絆到了後方人的桌腳，一個踉蹌，往後便倒，背心壓人，屁股碾桌，直把桌上的茶水撞得灑了一地，登時惹出了一陣哄堂大笑。有人笑得涕淚滿面，有人則樂得滾倒在地，喧鬧之聲久久不絕。\r\n\r\n  韓生漲紅了臉，深覺羞愧難當，一股火氣從腔子裡湧出，再也按捺不住，突然一拍桌子，直身站起，大聲說道：「你們覺得放小蛇到袋子裡嚇唬別人，好有趣麼？若這蛇有毒，被咬了豈不當場斃命？」一小眼書生站起來叫道：「害怕便是害怕，你哪來那麼多藉口圓你謊子？」其他人也跟著起鬨道：「膽小鬼，兔兒郎，東怕西怕叫娘娘；娘娘說，兔兒郎，南吵北吵少嚷嚷！」\r\n\r\n  韓生指著眾書生，大聲叫道：「你們…你們狗咬呂洞賓，不識好人心！若不是我丟出青蛇，牠發威起來，只怕你們各個遭殃，如今卻反過來笑我膽小，你說這還有天理麼？」眾人聞言，登時又是一陣嘻笑怒罵之聲。忽然間，有一身材矮胖的書生走向前來，向韓生道：「你口口聲稱自己並不膽小，咱們各個也並非沒生眼睛，哪一個肯相信？你若有種，圓夜之日，自個兒一人到山上那破廟裡頭走一遭，咱們親眼看著，那可就沒話說啦！」韓生熱血沸騰，想也不想，當下一口答應。\r\n\r\n  是月十五日之夜，眾書生吵吵嚷嚷，都擁著韓生上山。韓生左顧右盼，但見月黑風高，樹影搖曳，漆黑的林子裡，時有晚重唧唧，禽獸幽鳴。偶爾不知從哪刮起幾陣強風，直把樹葉搖得窸窣作響，好似幽靈竊笑，女鬼低泣。韓生心裡碰碰亂跳，於自己逞一時之氣好生後悔。但自己此時若臨陣脫逃，那當真比原先沒有答應他們還要顯得窩囊。沒奈何，只得硬著頭皮繼續上山。\r\n\r\n  過了一時辰，眾人終於來到廟院之外。此時正值子時，頭頂上的月光掩映，被飄來的雲霧逐漸遮住。眾人目不見物，點起了火把，見那門邊圍欄損壞，無法上鎖，於是輕推而入，來到中庭。矮胖書生遞了一袋米給韓生，說道：「你進到裡頭，把所到之處用米灑過，否則誰也不知你會不會一直躲在門口，等時間到了再出來呼隆我們？」\r\n\r\n  韓生勉強接過，繃緊了身子，一步一步緩緩地向廟門移動。才剛行至門口，那門忽然嘎地一聲打開了。韓生臉色發白，兩手緊握著胸前的護身符，念幾聲阿密陀佛，才壯起膽子，跨門入內。\r\n\r\n  舉火把望室內一照，只見塵沙蓋地，蛛絲滿佈，每走一步，便有許多沙土遊絲隨風飄揚。火光映著兩側神像，在蝕壁上微微顫動，大大小小藍藍綠綠的神像，瞪大雙目，咧嘴而笑，面貌猙獰已極，似是隨時都要跳出來吃人一般。韓生一見駭然，急忙趨步入室，只想灑著些米便快快出來。\r\n\r\n  韓生穿過重重倒塌的神龕與佛桌，還有幾尊成泥的觀音像，來到了內室。忽然聽見隱隱的腳步聲，參差著口齒咀嚼之聲。韓生聽得寒毛直豎，想要掉頭離去，一時間竟迷失了方向。慢行間，走進一室，火光照處，映入眼簾的竟是一團綠色毛物，有兩人寬高，生了三顆碗口大的眼睛，和兩隻人手臂一般長，自下而上的銀白色獠牙，嘴裡兀自咀嚼著一隻人腿，身旁有一件被扯個粉碎的僧袍。\r\n\r\n  韓生嚇得一顆心險些跳將出腔子來，整個身子不由得望後直退，誰知撞上了身後一只鐵碗，鐵碗墜地，發出哐噹好大一聲響。那妖驚聞，立時抬起頭來，瞪著三隻亮晃晃的眼睛，蠢蠢欲動。韓生嚇得魂飛魄散，牙齒嘎嘎作響，想逃跑，腳卻不聽使喚，反而撲倒在地。那妖見了，直身站起，仰面咆哮，聲音極盡刺耳難聽，張著血盆大口，便望韓生疾撲過去。韓生心裡一涼，縮緊著身子，幾乎要暈去。不料那怪還未觸及韓生，韓生胸口間竟出現了一道光亮，炫目奪人，那怪霎時間像被閃電電到一般，驚吼一聲，被彈得向外飛出數丈，又在地滾了數圈，才手腳並立，藏頭縮頸，慌慌張張地逃了。\r\n\r\n  韓生驚魂未定，見那怪抱頭逃竄，更是驚愕不已，左手伸入領口之中，取出一塊環形翠玉，玉面上有一長串符咒沿際而刻，竟就是適才救了自己一命的護身符！韓生手撫翠玉，暗暗慶幸，此時卻不敢多待，隨意將米一灑，匆匆而出。\r\n\r\n  卻說院外眾書生也聽聞怪物咆哮之聲，都擠成一團咯咯發顫，忽見韓生趨步而出，臉色慘白，忙迎了上來，過問情況。韓生將廟裡所見之事一一說了，又加油添醋一番，將自己勇猛對敵的事跡，說得活靈活現。眾書生們雖然半信半疑，卻沒人趕再踏進那廟門一步。\r\n\r\n  回家後，韓生點起油燈，獨自呆坐床上，想起今夜險些被妖怪吃掉，仍自心有餘悸。發愣間，忽聽得臥房中有悉悉簌簌的聲響，循聲望去，見自己的背袋竟在蠕蠕而動！韓生驚叫一聲，忙捧起矮几上的翡翠瓶，緩緩靠近，心想如若是妖魅鬼怪之類，便立刻砸了它們。卻見那袋口乍開，裡頭蹦出了一隻手掌大小的獵犬，毛色白栗相間，搖著尾巴蹦跳奔走，活潑雀躍，甚是可愛。韓生用手輕撫，覺其毛輕軟綿密，把玩了一會兒，心想：「如今同窗們不放青蛇到我背袋，反放了一隻可愛的狗兒，應是佩服我這次勇氣可嘉罷？」得意了半晌，只覺睡意上湧，把小獵犬藏入盒子裡，先自睡了。\r\n\r\n  此後韓生每日餵食，呵護甚厚。偶見鄰家女孩路經其門，便向狗兒訴其愛慕之意；時被同窗嬉鬧惡整，便與狗兒洩其煩悶之念；每當讀書有感而發，便與狗兒論其見解，種種心事，無所不訴。那犬甚有靈性，當韓生說話，每每注視其目，偶以叫聲或擺尾相應。\r\n\r\n  數月過去，適逢九九重陽之節，家家戶戶插茱萸、焚艾草、飲雄黃。韓生好藏美酒，是日取了兩大甕，一尊盛菊花、一瓶攬雄黃，獨坐中庭，舉杯啜飲。暢飲之際，臥在韓生腿上的小獵犬忽然抬頭，一個騰身，竟跳進了裝滿雄黃酒的大甕之中。韓生大驚，忙要去捉，卻聽甕中傳來連續不斷，呼嚕呼嚕之聲，緊接著甕身碎裂，成了十七廿八塊。只見裡頭一團栗色毛物逐漸長大，直身立起，竟只比韓生矮一個頭。韓生見了驚異更甚，原來自己養的獵犬喝了雄黃酒後，竟變成了一隻怪物！韓生嚇得一個踉蹌翻倒在地，左手忙從領口取出翠玉，對著那犬怪大聲叫道：「妖怪別過來！」\r\n\r\n  那犬怪瞟了翠玉一眼，乾笑道：「你那玉，只對二流妖怪有功效，對老子卻是無用！怎麼，你餵了老子這麼多月了，難道還怕俺忘恩負義，對你不利麼？」韓生聞言，心裡鬆了一口氣。只聽那犬怪道：「待我先取你家東西用用。」於是拆掉窗帘，念了串咒語，那窗帘霎時變作一件白羅袍，又取一盞酒器，道了聲「變」，變成了一頂官帽，穿戴於身。\r\n\r\n  韓生在旁看傻了，忍不住問道：「你倒底是何方神聖？」犬怪道：「甚麼神聖倒不敢當，俺上輩子本為捉妖道士，只因地藏王菩薩坐騎下凡，誤殺了牠，因此被懲下輩子投狗胎。如今我雖為狗，但行業仍舊，神妖之界皆稱我犬判官。我本有一為僧的主人，那日至鳳凰山中古廟捉妖，不幸被妖吃了。唉，被吃了倒好，那人總把俺當作畜生看待。」牠停下看韓生的表情，嘿了一聲道：「你別看俺生成這副模樣，俺的心裡和你們一般，也是有自尊地！」\r\n\r\n  韓生道：「既有自尊，幹啥子還變成一隻小狗，跟我回家，又騙了我那麼多心事？這可一點兒也不好玩。」犬判官呸了一聲道：「你以為俺閒著沒事，變成小狗來聽你說鬼話麼？老子煩都煩死了！只因那日俺隨僧捉妖，一時大意，被妖吹了一口臭氣，不及抵擋，再起來時，就變成那副德性啦！幸得你及時來到廟裡，用護身符驅逐了妖怪，我趁機翻入你背袋，這才留得一條命在。直至今日，我飲了雄黃，才得將體內妖氣驅散，變回本來面目。」韓生驚嘬嘬地聽著，幾乎難以置信，一時間竟不知該說甚麼。\r\n\r\n  卻聽犬判官道：「如今俺回復原身，本該要走，但看在你救過俺一命的份上，你既有難，俺便應當留下相助，待事一成，咱們後會無期。」韓生大惑不解道：「我這好端端的，你卻說我有甚麼難了？」犬判官舉目四顧，搖頭道：「我瞧你這房屋四周，近日青氣頗重，你吸入那些青氣，臉色日漸難看，只怕有青毛獅精，這幾日就要上門尋仇了。」韓生吃驚道：「獅精？我這輩子連獅子都不曾見過，牠如何無緣無故，上門找我尋仇？」犬判官道：「這我就不知道了。」只見牠從口中吐出一只牙齒般的小葫蘆，兩手接住時，已變成手掌大小，走出屋外，於房屋四角灑了符水。韓生卻見屋內之氣逐漸清晰，直至回復原本的清亮潔淨，這才發掘屋內青氣滯留，竟已有好一段時間了。韓生見狀，不由得駭然失色。\r\n\r\n  犬判官向韓生道：「你先過來讓我瞧瞧。」韓生依示向前。犬判官脫去其紗羅帽，一手置其頭頂，口中念了一串咒語。韓生登覺頭暈目眩，雖然人仍站立於中庭之上，其靈魂意識竟似墜入了地心深處，另一個時空之中。韓生第一幕所見之景，乃是一大城門，上頭刻著「平城」兩大字，其身游移入城，穿梭於熙來攘往的人群之中，人們交談所用之語，自己竟全然不解。穿過人群，映入眼簾的是一座寺院，牌坊上寫著「聖山寺」。\r\n\r\n  寺廟裡頭火光烈焰，熊熊激燃，閃得幾乎讓人睜不開眼睛。忽然廟門口閃出一隻屋檐高度的火獅，張著大焱血口，一個縱身，直望韓生飛撲而來。韓生失聲驚叫，頓覺身後一股吸力將自己望後直拉，倒著身子，扯著穿過人群之間。那火獅於空中騰飛，緊跟韓生，愈漸接近。韓生被拉向後，直出城門，兩門關上，將火獅鎖於其內。韓生但覺頭昏眼花，其魂不斷向上騰昇，直至與己軀殼合而為一，這才回到了中庭之上。\r\n\r\n  韓生嚇得幾乎要昏厥，勉強扶住犬判官的手，顫抖著問道：「我適才所見，究竟是甚麼事兒？」犬判官道：「你見了這幾幕場景，想來應知道了大概。平城乃北魏的首都，北魏初期，城內之人多用鮮卑語交談，因此時間距今，至少也有五百年之久。你與青毛獅結怨，可追溯至你前七世之時。那時北魏太武帝在位，你在朝廷為官，專責此期的毀佛行動。傳說成安有座聖山寺，十分靈驗，你親自率人拆毀此廟，摔神倒佛，並砸爛數頭石獅。而青毛石獅是裡頭唯一僥倖生存的。青毛石獅眼見神佛搗毀、石獅碎散，立誓要報仇，因此變成獅子，隱居山中修煉，並伺機尋仇。」\r\n\r\n  韓生聞言，面色發白，顫聲道：「既是前七世的仇怨，當時便應了結，如何拖到現在，還要尋我麻煩？」犬判官道：「話說妖魔須有五百年道行方能成精，你那寶玉護身符，防得妖卻防不得精。那獅妖修煉，還未成精，而你此後幾世有寶玉護身，因此僥倖避掉了災難。不幸到你這世，獅妖恰好修道圓滿，順利成精，你便有寶玉，再也難防牠向你尋仇。」韓生聽了急道：「造你這般說，我卻如何是好？如何是好？」犬判官淡然道：「你且莫管，山人自有妙計。」\r\n\r\n  六日之後，十五圓夜，窗外皓月當空，銀河耿耿，映著疏枝矮葉，隨風搖曳。臥房之內，油燈熒然，偶被夜風吹得微微發顫。犬判官低聲囑咐韓生，韓生點頭答允，隨即將油燈吹滅，室內登時一片漆黑。\r\n  至三更初響，忽有腳踏殘枝之聲，小院內的蛙聲蟲鳴頓時停了下來，隱隱地傳來一陣低吼。月光下一道青影閃過，簾幕驚風乍起，青毛獅精一對圓眼閃著黃光，\r\n\r\n  在臥房之內一眨一眨，緩緩游移至韓生床榻跟前，沈著嗓子道：「骯臟狗官！五百年前的孽障，莫以為死了轉世，就能僥倖逃過，如今爺爺上門向你討這筆帳，只教你求生不得，求死不能，永世沒法超生！」見那韓生緊縮在被窩裡頭，動也不動，殺機大起，登時大吼一聲，飛撲床前，一張血口望著韓生，連人帶被，便要撕成兩半。不料那被飛濺起來之時，不見一張床的血肉橫飛，卻是一袋子的臭泥熏天！青毛獅精又驚又怒，回過頭去，卻見一隻似犬非犬的怪物立於窗邊，一對圓溜溜的雙目映著月光，炯炯閃爍。\r\n\r\n  青毛獅精譏笑道：「我道是誰，原來是條狗腿子。奴才護主，爺爺趕你不走，多殺了你這條一文不值的狗命，只是玷污了我一口寶刀！」犬判官罵道：「我把你個潑毛團，當真有眼無珠！你道自己修煉了五百年道行，便是天下無敵麼？你快上前吃老子一劍，只教你頃刻化為虀粉！」瞬時騰雲駕霧，來到了寂院半空，青毛獅精駕青雲，從後趕上。\r\n\r\n  只見青毛獅精自鼻中吐出一道青氣，至手中時，已幻化成一口寒氣逼人的寶刀；同時間，犬判官也從口中吐出一道白氣，握於手中，揮一揮，變成了一把銀光鋒爍的寶劍。霎時間，但見四周寒風颯颯，怪霧森森，刀劍交舞，一青一白，快若流星趕月，電光疾閃，鋪天蓋地，籠罩了整座庭院。鋒刀利劍幻化無邊，一會兒似猛虎伏岸，一會兒又如蛟龍翻騰，環繞飛旋，情勢兇險已極。\r\n\r\n  青毛獅精見犬判官實力不在己下，於是賣弄神通，吐出一口火焰。細見那火焰卻也生了眼睛鼻子嘴巴，咧嘴獰笑，望犬判官，照面飛來。犬判官揮舞長劍，劍尖指向烈燄，繞圓而轉，霎時間成了一道銀白色的水輪，將那火焰捲將進去。劍尖再逆轉時，一隻水龍從中疾游而出，霎時間，已將青毛獅精團團圍住。青毛獅精提起火刀，使起平生之力苦苦奮鬥，然有句話道：「抽刀斷水水更流」無論牠如何橫砍縱砍、直砍側砍，於這水龍自是渾然無用。\r\n\r\n  且說修煉五百成精，再修五百而成仙。青毛獅精此時方知，眼前這似犬非犬之物，恐怕只消再練個十年，便能飛天而成仙。此時發覺，身子各處早給抓出了數道傷痕。青毛獅精思念及此，已然心怯，收了寶刀，放開拳頭，搖身一變，變作一隻野鴿兒，抖開翅，慌慌張張飛入暗空之中。犬判官睜眼觀看，收回水龍，抖擻精神，變作一隻大梟，沖天而上，張嘴去銜。青毛獅精一個俯衝，變成一匹快馬，馳騁於山林之中。犬判官直衝而下，變作一頭獵豹，緊緊直追。青毛獅精驚慌失措，見樹林深處，隱隱有座古廟，情急間，翻枝踏葉，變作一隻貓兒，翻牆入內，躲了起來。\r\n\r\n  犬判官認得此廟，提高警覺，入廟門，現原身，四顧張望，但見四周死氣沈沈地，一片闃靜，即便是自己微微的呼吸聲，都能聽得一清二楚。犬判官屏氣凝神，提劍護身，但見殘壁朽架之上，所刻所擺的神像，或怒或笑，做攻擊之狀，與前次所見幾乎相同，並無異狀。再走一陣，穿過迴廊，忽見眼前立著兩道門。犬判官登覺有異，心道：「卻是怪哉，前次來時，俺倒不記得這裡有兩道門？」眼觀二門，但見左邊一門兩側與上頭雕工精細，有若一頭猛獅，張大了口，蓄勢待發。犬判官瞧得戰戰兢兢，往旁一看，卻見那門邊的柱子，正淌著血呢！\r\n\r\n  犬判官故作驚訝道：「哎喲！俺還不曾見過柱子被搗了，還會流血哩！俺不如也砸了這道門，瞧它滴不滴血？」話未說完，但聞一陣震耳欲聾的怒吼之聲，那左門轟隆隆地震動起來，門上門下霎時間各出現了一排鋒利獠牙，猛力合將起來。倘若犬判官再前進個一步，頭與身必定當場裂成兩半。但見那石刻獅子自牆中跳出，冒在空中不見了。左門與雕刻霎時間退回成一座殘垣頹壁，果然是青毛獅精所變。\r\n\r\n  正瞧間，身後忽然一股勁風，直望後腦襲來。犬判官急急向旁滾了一圈，但見四周空無一物，哪裡還有青毛獅精的蹤影？犬判官罵道：「臭毛團，你道使了個隱身法，老子便找不到你了麼？俺可沒閑功夫，與你玩這些小孩兒的把戲！這會兒只教你現出原身罷！」口裡一吐，吐出一只葫蘆，把葫蘆裡頭的符水望空中一灑，但見頭頂忽然一頭石獅墜將下來，哐噹撞地，動也不動。\r\n\r\n  青毛獅精本為一具靈氣的石獅修煉而成，如今現出原形，靈氣鎖於石體之中，饒牠如何憤怒慾狂，卻遲遲不得動彈。犬判官噓了一口氣，掏出一袋手掌大小的皮囊，將石獅裝了進去。即便石獅與犬判官一般大小，這囊袋卻如無底洞似地，裝載自如。\r\n\r\n  待要離去，忽聽身後嘓嘓一聲，只見一隻全身綠色的三眼妖怪，正鄧鄧呆呆地盯著自己。犬判官嘿一聲道：「老冤家，老子上次沒有捉著你，如今你也逃不掉啦！」但見那怪低伏於地，吸氣吸得全身圓鼓鼓地，突然間一吐妖氣，猛往犬判官面門吹來。\r\n\r\n  犬判官此次也不大意，抽出寶劍在身前揮舞，形成了一道白色密網將妖氣包著，寶劍瞬時變成了棍棒，兩手握著，順勢望那白網一揮，網內妖氣便朝那怪直吹而去。又聽嘓嘓一聲，那怪竟變成了一隻癩蝦膜！犬判官心裡嘀咕：「這蝦膜還未成精便煉成這般法術，若成精了，豈不危害人們更甚？」手一揮，也收在皮囊裡頭，跨步走出了古廟。\r\n\r\n  古廟之外，曉風拂面，偶有鳥囀清音，盪漾耳際。此時天剛破曉，遠處蒼山散著金光。鳳凰山天邊，仍掛著一輪逐漸淡去的月。犬判官遙望景色，心頭慨嘆道：「想想這獅，倒也是有情有義之輩。家園被焚，族人被殺，僥倖逃亡，豈有徒哀傷而不報仇之理？若換作我，定也會這麼做。而今捉了牠，卻又該如何處置是好？」沈思間，但見空宵之際，忽然有金光萬道，伴著滾滾紅霓，一朵五色祥雲自遠而至，後有千條瑞氣迆邐漫延。犬判官愣愣凝視，只覺恍若夢中，直至祥雲停落眼前，這才看清駕雲之人，竟是大願地藏王菩薩。\r\n\r\n  犬判官見了，忙躬身行禮。菩薩道：「犬判官，別來無恙？聽說你虜獲一隻獅精，卻打算如何處置？」犬判官道：「卑職瞧這獅精，試圖傷人，乃因身負血海之仇所致，正是情有可原，望其能從輕發落。」菩薩點頭道：「既如此說，你將牠放出來罷。自我失了坐騎以後，再也不曾遇著如此奇才。」犬判官會意，將石獅自皮囊放出。菩薩手持金珠，輕輕一彈，化作閃閃金粉，灑落石獅身上。\r\n\r\n  只見石身逐漸碎裂，裡頭躍出了一頭健壯的金獅，凜然而立，顧盼煒如。犬判官見狀，心下驚歎不已。那金獅行至菩薩跟前，恭恭敬敬地蹲身在地，菩薩套了一金箍於其頭頂，翻身而上，向犬判官點了點頭，駕著金獅，飛昇上天，漸漸地變成一道金光，瞬間消失在晨空宿雲之間。犬判官淡淡一笑，縱起雲頭，飄飛而去。\r\n\r\n  卻說韓生正襟危坐，一整夜焦慮難眠，直至旭日東昇，見犬判官踏雲歸來，這才大鬆口氣，笑臉相迎。只聞犬判官說道：「青毛獅精一事已解決，如今俺該做的也做了，俺們就此道別罷。」韓生聞言，依依不捨，一再挽留。犬判官沈默半晌，四顧張望，目光停留在一把高掛於牆壁上的寶劍，緩緩說道：「你俺既然有緣，今日俺便傳與你一套劍法，盼你日後好好練習，替這世間剷除邪惡，俺們也不枉相識一場。」韓生聞言喜不自勝，趕緊跪地拜其為師。\r\n\r\n  犬判官取下寶劍，說道：「此劍稱作斬妖劍，乃稀世珍寶。只因沾染了世俗之氣，而失其鋒芒，暗淡無光。」語畢，取了鍋碗點了火，注入符咒與神水，將劍放入煮夠多時，只見劍身發光奪目，絢彩逼人，果然是把好劍。犬判官道：「這世上仍有許多邪妖厲鬼，到處危害肆虐，俺授你劍法，但盼你心地光明，救困扶危，進而匡時濟俗。」韓生連聲答應。\r\n\r\n  犬判官將一套劍法完整使出，並受其劍訣。雖然韓生看似一膽小懦弱的書呆子，但練起劍來極有天賦且專心十足，犬判官偶從旁指點，不過花了三天時間，便將一路劍法練個精熟。犬判官又授其內功心法之訣，確認韓生記熟後，遞給他一袋皮囊道：「劍法、內功，你已捉到訣竅。持續修煉，待功力已成，你便可將天地間妖魔，裝入皮囊之中。你若有心，俺們十年後青城山再見，如今時間已到，但願後會有期。」韓生連連稱謝，又向犬判官拜了好幾拜。犬判官駕祥雲，乘瑞風，飄然離去。\r\n\r\n  韓生此後更加專心修煉，若干年後，傳言其在東南一帶大有作為，專替人斬妖除魔，且不收一文錢。韓生遊歷在外，如此數年，某日上了青城山後，便再也無人聽得他的消息了。\r\n\r\n`\r\n\r\n;\r\n\r\nclass Wolf extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n\r\n
