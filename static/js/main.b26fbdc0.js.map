兩年前，党項部落猖狂為亂，引發朝廷憂慮，故命大理司直六人分別駐守鹽、夏、靈、涇、邠、勝六大重鎮。那年初冬破曉，我無意間闖入此地，發現好一片澄淨之湖，隨著周圍光線照耀變化，湖面顏色隨之變換舞動，既幻而玄，且實且虛，置身其間，猶若夢中。聽當地居民傳言，這湖底深處，存在著一座藍寶石砌成的龍宮，龍宮裡有顆夜明珠，將整座湖底照耀如同白晝。夜晚時，夜明珠與月光相輝映，從水底深處透出寶石般的湛藍。太陽升起時，明珠火鏡兩相照，各色流光蜿蜒纏繞，彷彿遊於太虛之中。以至日間，明珠光澤愈漸減弱，湖面才恢復原本的碧綠。凡觀此景者，皆覺恍入仙境而忘卻塵俗，故名此湖為忘塵湖......

}];\r\n\r\nlet paragraphs = `\r\n中秋圓夜，夜闌人靜。東晉孝宗永和五年的蜀地，縱然於六街三市，萬籟之音仍顯得格外清晰。似乎整座城郊，盡隨著唧唧之聲沉沉睡去。唯獨一坐落在龍門山山腳處的唐家莊，張燈結彩，人聲鼎沸，和空寂的月色，成了強烈對比。\r\n周旋在燈火通明的大廳上，七八個士紳與眾多門客，在高級紅木桌椅上飲酒作樂，身旁圍繞著歌妓和丫鬟，空氣中彌漫著酒香與濃濃的胭脂味。這味兒便是來自作客的官家大小姐，曲嫣。\r\n\r\n只見她濃妝豔抹，嬌媚動人，又值妙齡，瞧得在場人們，無一不為之神魂顛倒。雖然此時和大家齊身坐在紅木桌椅上，但她的心早飄向昏暗、寂靜的一方。沉默許久，她起身轉向走廊的一端，望昏暗的樓梯間，姍姍而行。\r\n\r\n同屬於大戶人家，二樓卻格外黯然岑寂。從樓梯間傳來的歡笑聲，使二樓顯得更加落寞悽涼。慘淡的月色潑灑在陽台上，映出了一旁桂花樹與九重葛的輪廓，和一幢長長的人影，也為輕聲的嘆息增添了無數愁思。\r\n那嘆息之人，喚作宋天映，年近而立，生得丰姿英偉，相貌軒昂。他眉頭深鎖，憑欄沈思，滿腹心事地凝視著對面樓閣中彈古箏的女子，但聽那琴聲悠揚，卻在音符之中夾雜淡淡的哀愁，聽著聽著，不由得痴了。\r\n\r\n待有意識時，身旁已多了一人，卻是那位官家大小姐。月光照射下，只見她淚光閃動，如帶雨的梨花，嬌柔欲墜。兩人默然無語，惟有痴痴望著那輪滿月，高掛中天。\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n此時已近三更時分，書房之內紅燭高燒，人影顫動。宋天映在窗邊來回踱步，思念之間，門呀地一聲打開。曲嫣手捧熱茶，玉步而入，將茶碗輕放在几席上，淡淡道了聲：「官人請用茶。」轉身離去。\r\n\r\n宋天映愣愣望著她的背影，隱隱覺得這女子神色間帶著一股無法抑制的哀傷。不知是為情所困，還是有志難伸？\r\n几上熱茶香氣四溢，宋天映嗅了嗅，卻捨不得喝。 遠遠傳來的琴聲縈繞耳際，似嘆息，似呻吟，琴心相挑，百般柔情蜜意飄忽其間。他閉上眼睛，深深吸一口氣，將一封短信放入懷中，手端茶杯，踏出了書房。\r\n他放輕腳步，繞過多人走過的路段，悄聲步向迴廊的另一端，而纏綿宛轉的琴聲不時在心頭盪漾。\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n小小朱閣之中，燈光脈脈，琴聲縈繞，纖纖巧手，撥弄琴弦。這彈琴的女子，眉似春山，眼若秋水，鬒髮如雲，傾瀉而下。\r\n\r\n但見她眉梢輕皺，滿腹心事，向誰傾訴？ 只得藉這古箏與手指，奏出她無盡心酸。\r\n她望著窗外溶溶月色，琴聲由悲悽漸轉溫柔，思緒墜入了回憶之中：\r\n\r\n「我姓景，單名一個涵字。生於豫州世族大家，從小生活富足優渥，閒來讀些經史子集，偶爾跟著家中武師學些武藝。十九歲前，一直過得悠閒愜意。直到那年，兩地貴族聯姻，把我嫁到了蜀地唐家莊，關在這華麗卻寂寞的樓閣之中。\r\n\r\n唐家莊莊主唐易是個好色之徒，三番兩次進來房中，想侮辱於我，都因我極力反抗而作罷。我總想著要離開這裡，但若離開了，卻又何去何從？思索多日，仍沒有答案，我愈想愈傷心，一時衝動，竟選擇了自盡這條路。\r\n\r\n「那一日晚上，天上也是掛著一輪溶溶滿月。我站在高几兒上，擦乾淚水，將吊在梁柱上的白布帶纏在頸中，待要把高几踢去，房門突然間被撞了開來。定神一看，竟是個男子，渾身是血，進了房間便倒地不起。\r\n我探他鼻息，呼吸微弱，於是趕忙將他抱到床上，想替他止血。卻聽走廊外面急促的腳步聲，只得迎上門口。但見外頭來了三個士兵，向我厲聲問道：『有人來過這裡麼？』我指著走廊另一端道：『我剛才看見一人，慌慌張張地往那裡逃去了，卻不知為甚麼？』那三個士兵不答腔，頭也不回的走了。\r\n\r\n我關上門，趕緊回到床邊，拿起丹藥替那人止血。唐易那壞人嫉賢妒才，近日追捕那些見解與他相左的正義之人，許多志士慌忙逃竄，這人想必也是其中之一。\r\n我陪在他旁邊守了一整晚，也不知何時打起盹來，醒來時，卻見那人側著身子，呆呆望著我。我頓時羞紅了臉，低下頭來。忽聽他有氣無力地說道：『多謝姑娘相救。』我點頭相應，接著又是一陣沈默。\r\n\r\n待又修養數天，他才向我說明來歷。原來他是唐家莊的一位謀士，叫做宋天映，輔佐前莊主多年，統領整個唐家莊。那時的唐家莊，秉持著經世濟民的理念，順服於晉國，支持桓溫桓大將軍北伐，以衛漢民族之天下。可是前莊主逝世後，其子唐易即位，率領了一批新的勢力，叛離晉國，鏟除過去父親身邊的謀士。而前幾日的殺戮，便是那剷除計劃的其中一環。\r\n\r\n「我聽完後擔心道：『那你養完傷後快點走罷！』 他搖頭道：『我答應了前莊主，不管他生前死後，都要輔佐莊主，帶領唐家莊扶危持顛，匡救時局，以解民與倒懸之苦。現下情況，我只得說服莊主把我留下，但願唐家莊有挽救的可能。』\r\n\r\n「此後一日，他的傷勢漸癒，離開樓閣，輔佐莊主去了。每隔兩三天，他總會回來找我，有時還帶些珠寶首飾、精緻點心，那時候，我已經沒有逃脫的意念了。直到不久前，他說唐家莊的有為志士已蕩然無存，回到過去唐家莊的理念也不過是鏡花水月。他的行跡已被懷疑，為了我和他的安全，不能常常見我。從他的眼神，可以看出百般的愧疚與無奈。他牽起我的手，溫言道：『寡固不可以敵眾，唐家莊已不再是久留之地，這幾日我聯絡上桓大將軍的部署，日後你和我一同投奔桓將軍門下罷。』 那是他最後一次來找我了。」思念及此，景涵輕輕嘆了口氣。\r\n\r\n忽聽得咚咚兩聲，卻是有人敲門。景涵愣半晌，見著前方之人，登時臉泛紅暈，嬌羞無限。那便是她朝思暮想的意中人，宋天映。\r\n\r\n宋天映微微一笑，神色十分溫和，卻帶著幾分歉意。他將茶放在一旁的高几上，過去坐在景涵身旁，景涵抿嘴一笑，將頭輕輕倚在他懷裡，他則溫柔地輕撫她的頭。纏綿多時，外頭傳來碰地一陣關門聲，從水晶簾望去，只見對面樓閣微亮，數個人影集聚房內，似在談論要事。宋天映直身坐起，不覺憂慮起來，景涵輕聲相詢。\r\n\r\n宋天映問道：「涵兒識得伍子胥麼？」 景涵道：「伍子胥？是春秋末期的吳國大夫麼？」宋天映點頭道：「我曾聽聞將近一個月之前，有幾個崆峒武人在吐谷渾一帶掘到一卷戰國帛書，帛書裡頭標示了伍子胥墓的所在與內部結構。相傳吳王夫差逼伍子胥自盡，將屍體丟入錢塘江後，其故里官宦、士紳、鄉親替他築墓。為防盜墓，共築一百座墳，九十九座假墳在河西，真墳埋在河東江津一地，並修有一廟。這伍子胥是著名的軍事家、謀略家。他的墓中不乏金銀珠寶，卻也不乏兵書武譜和治國經典。現下時局動盪，民不聊生，若能尋得那些治國良策以匡救時事，豈不是美事一件？\r\n\r\n「桓將軍好不容易在永和二年平定蜀地，不過三年，唐易便有心帶領蜀地叛晉。那幾個崆峒武人下落不明，而唐易與他的謀士們又對著那帛書打鬼主意，若給他碰上那群武人，奪去帛書，蜀地叛晉，只怕計日可俟了。」\r\n\r\n宋天映輕嘆一聲，說道：「事不宜遲。你先收拾好東西，我們明日子時就起程。」從懷中取出一封短信遞與景涵道：「這是桓將軍部署差信使送來的。我們只要到了距唐家莊三十里外的見心湖畔，對方會派人馬接應，這樣對你也會比較安全。」景涵握著宋天映的手柔聲道：「你自己也要小心一點。」\r\n\r\n一會兒，急促的腳步聲從對面走廊傳來。從窗外望去，卻見曲嫣慌張地打開宋天映的房門，不見人影，臉色更加慘白。\r\n\r\n宋天映扶著景涵站起，說道：「不知發生什麼事，我這就去看看。你先在這兒等著，我待會兒回來找你。」\r\n景涵站在原地，望著宋天映離去的身影。忽瞥見高几兒上的茶，聞得淡淡茗香，捧起茶杯啜飲一口，緩步回床邊。\r\n\r\n忽然身後一冰冷的聲音道：「兩人見面就卿卿我我的，也不知有旁人在場。這事若給其他人知曉了，你們還能活著離開麼？」\r\n\r\n景涵從床上跳起，吃了一驚，道：「誰？」 一陣風襲來，吹動了水晶簾，瞥向窗口，卻不見人影。\r\n\r\n驀地，背後傳來一聲冷笑。景涵回頭一看，見是一個二十來歲的男子，頭戴華陽巾，身披錦繡衣，手持白羽扇，卻是個瀟灑風流雅士。景涵愣道：「是你？」 原來這人是揚州世族豪門的公子哥，人稱凌公子。\r\n\r\n景涵擋在門口，怒道：「你想做甚麼？」 凌公子訕笑道：「沒事沒事，不過來拿個東西，何需勞動姑娘大駕？快回去坐好罷。」右手拈起一封短信，側頭瞧了瞧，放入懷中。\r\n\r\n景涵阿地一聲，見凌公子拿走桓將軍捎來的密信，嚇得冷汗直流，顫聲道：「要…要怎麼樣你才肯還我？」 凌公子道：「說了你也不信，捉得到我再告訴你罷！」轉身望窗戶，縱身一躍，消失在一片黑暗中。\r\n\r\n景涵心中慌亂異常，也不思索，立時奪窗而出，緊跟著前方的颯颯風聲，在屋脊之上疾身騰躍，腳下毫不停緩。至最外圍一片屋緣，縱身而下，藉著一旁屋檐欄柱，減緩了下墜之勢。眼見下方一片空地，零零散散站幾個守夜人。\r\n凌公子喊道：「讓開讓開，爺爺悶著，那個敢擋路的，你爺爺一人一腳，通通點翻！」那幾人也當真懼怕凌公子，沒頭沒尾地慌忙逃竄。凌公子將騎馬之人攔下，騰身上馬，又將另一個馬主踢下馬背，先自走了。景涵從後趕上，騎了另一匹馬追去。\r\n\r\n兩匹健馬腳不點地向前疾馳，直入樹林，穿枝拂葉，來到大片荒野之中。 凌公子一扯馬韁，速度慢了下來。景涵縱馬從後迎上，伸手朝他捉去。凌公子忽地一個翻身，閃到了馬腹一側，只教景涵這招抓了個空。景涵雙腳一蹬，從馬背上躍起，空中一記旋風腿望凌公子胸口踢去。凌公子的武功自也不弱，他不貿然進攻，但見招拆招，所有拳法都被輕鬆擋下了。\r\n\r\n當景涵不知所措之際，忽聽凌公子說道：「你和宋天映投靠桓溫，為甚麼不算我一份？」景涵一愣，呆望著凌公子，不敢相信適才所聽到的。凌公子不理，逕自走去荒煙漫草中的一座孤墳後方，提出一顆血淋淋的人頭拋在地上。景涵大吃一驚，認得是唐易身邊，一位姓彭的親信。\r\n\r\n凌公子道：「幾日前，傳遞桓將軍書信的使者剛來到龍門山山腳，便被這王八逮個正著，告了密，把那使者殺了。爾後傳信給宋天映的使者，卻是莊裡食客扮的。我在一旁瞧得清清楚楚，而你們卻渾然不知。若不是我花費心思，好意提醒，你和你那情郎，只怕沒能再多活幾天。」景涵面色慘白道：「你…你素來和唐易姣好，為甚麼願意幫我們，還要投靠桓大將軍門下？」凌公子呸地一聲道:「你甚麼時候見我跟他姣好了！ 我是為了帛書才來這裡的。此書內容你已知曉，而我是來取書獻與將軍的。」 景涵低頭不語。\r\n\r\n凌公子望著景涵，只見她的面龐在月光照射下，隱隱泛著一股青氣，心頭登時一震，問道：「你身體還好麼？」 景涵打了個寒顫道：「沒甚麼，只覺外頭有些冷。」 凌公子聽了臉色大變，擔心道：「你是不是中毒了？」\r\n\r\n啪噠噠…啪噠噠…\r\n\r\n只聽遠處達達馬蹄聲，隱隱傳來，甚是急驟。凌公子攜著景涵躲在孤墳後方。待他定眼凝視，雙馬已至眼前，騎在上面的各是兩條大漢。兵刀相交，雙劍急如閃電，鬥得十分激烈。\r\n\r\n只聽一留著山羊鬍的大漢罵道：「媽八羔子，一個膿包還跟人搶什麼帛書！老子他媽的先在你身上刺一百個透明窟窿再說！」持劍望另一人臉上扎出。 那沒鬍子的回刀一架，叫道：「放你娘的狗屁！你要帛書，根本是癩蝦膜想吃天鵝屁。滾回家撒泡尿照照自己那副鳥臉罷！ 」 兩人一攻一守，鬥了許久。躲在墳後的景涵，忽覺胸口疼痛欲裂，不由得輕輕阿了一聲。\r\n\r\n驀地，雜草四散，刀光閃閃。那兩大漢聽得人聲，竟一同攻來！\r\n\r\n凌公子抽出長劍，使了一記掃刀側空翻，轉身一道回旋，將敵人刀劍架去，順勢斜劈。但聽啊地一聲，兩個大漢都被砍中。荒野之中，劍光交閃，飛舞上下，凌公子的劍好似帶有黏性一般，只輕輕用尖端望敵人刀劍一拂，兵器登時脫手而出。 凌公子不待喘息之機，一招掃腿連著騰空飛腳相繼而出，只踢得兩大漢站立不住，各往兩側翻了出去。那鬍子大漢惱怒異常，挺起身子，一鼓作氣，往凌公子身上猛撲。凌公子一矮身形，一手抓那大漢左腕，另一手扣住腦門，猛轉一圈，只聽得殺豬般的大叫，那鬍子大漢已被拋出數丈之外。\r\n\r\n凌公子舉步如飛，擒住另一大漢，持長劍抵住脖子，問道：「你們兩個膿包可知道帛書的下落？」\r\n那沒鬍子的大漢嚇得魂不附體，結結巴巴道：「這…這也是聽說的…我只道那幾個失蹤的崆峒武人，最近跋山涉水，來到蜀地，現在…可能就在龍門山，唐家莊附近…」\r\n\r\n凌公子吃驚半晌，問道：「那些人長甚麼樣子？一共幾人？」那大漢道：「求求大人饒命，這我也不知道啊！」凌公子道：「諒你也不敢說謊，否則先刺你幾個窟窿！」一手把他推開。那大漢在草地上滾了一圈，跌跌撞撞，沒命似地逃了。\r\n\r\n凌公子沉默一會兒，見景涵已昏厥在草叢之中。四周寂靜無聲，荒野孤寂蕭條，忽聞風聲隆隆，林間窸窣作響，凌公子攜著景涵，策馬狂奔，隱沒在漆黑的樹林中。\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n卻說初在朱閣，原本沉浸在綿綿情意中的宋天映，望見曲嫣驚恐的模樣，立知發生情急之事，只得依依站起，迅速出了門外。\r\n\r\n途經通往對面樓閣的走廊間，卻被兩個留守的士兵發現，宋天映趕忙轉身往樓梯間奔去。不料樓梯轉角又有兩個士兵擋住了去路，其中一人用長矛尖端抵住他的喉頸，後方的兩士兵也追了過來。\r\n\r\n宋天映驚怒交集，料知行蹤已曝，不禁顧慮起景涵的安危。才一失神，已被身後士兵捏住後頸，壓倒在地，頸部順著長矛撫過處，劃破一道鮮血。那士兵右腳跟著提起，直向他腎俞穴踹去。\r\n\r\n宋天映冷然一笑，驀地左手一翻，只聽喀一聲響，對方左腕已被扭斷。那士兵勃然大怒，口裡祖宗十八代地亂嚷，舉起右手，朝宋天映的天靈蓋直劈下去。 宋天映急急一個翻身，只把士兵滾倒在地。那士兵煞不住手，凝氣聚力，直望地板劈去，砰一聲，痛得哇哇大叫。\r\n\r\n其餘三個士兵見狀，都拿起長矛一併攻來。宋天映拔劍在身，使了一招「風捲殘雲」，劍刃顫動，嗡嗡有聲，登時將三個士兵籠罩在劍光之中，三隻長矛瞬間劈成兩半。 宋天映嘿嘿一聲，望三人屁股，一人一腳，朝著樓梯踢將下去。\r\n\r\n不過一會兒，只聞得樓梯高處，隱隱傳來腳步聲，相較於那些士兵，卻是輕盈得多。 宋天映恐怕是唐易身邊，功力更高一層的部屬，趕忙翻出窗外，沿著牆柱，躍到對面樓房的長廊中。\r\n\r\n曲嫣在樓梯間左顧右盼，心裡頭焦躁不安，思忖道：「剛才的打鬥聲明是從這兒傳來，怎麼現在半個人也沒有？」 把頭探出窗戶外邊張望，忽然頸部一陣酸麻，跌坐在地，任她怎麼掙扎，全身竟是不得動彈。但曲嫣卻不緊張，亦不嗔怒，唯有愣愣地望著昏暗的樓梯間。四周寂靜無聲，想起悲傷的往事，不禁淚如泉湧。\r\n\r\n銀河耿耿，皓月當空，曲嫣停止啜泣，望著夜幕繁星點點，哽咽道：「爹爹，孩兒不想待在這裡了。讓孩兒上去陪你，好嗎？」幾道淡淡淚痕劃過她的臉龐。\r\n\r\n隱隱約約，有一模糊的身影在眼前晃動，逐漸逼近。依稀可見，是個高瘦的男子。曲嫣嘴角上揚，期盼道：「是…是爹爹嗎？」 等了許久，卻沒聽到答覆，只覺酸麻之感瞬間消失。她抹去淚水，見前方的人是宋天映，慘然一笑，淡淡道：「謝了。」\r\n\r\n宋天映問道：「適才誰點了你的穴道？」曲嫣聳聳肩，木然仰望星空，突然想起一事，驀地站起，緊張道：「宋官人，那杯茶你喝了麼？」宋天映見曲嫣臉色不對，立時會意，一個踉蹌，險些坐倒，顫聲道：「涵…涵兒…」\r\n\r\n曲嫣面色慘白，歉然道：「唐易請我送茶給你，卻不知他事前摻了毒藥，真的很對不起。」 宋天映搖了搖手，不願多說，一個轉身消失在樓梯間，曲嫣跟著慌然追去。\r\n\r\n兩人來到朱閣幽房，房內無人，高几兒上的茶已少半。曲嫣嘆了一口氣，試圖安慰宋天映，但話到了嘴邊卻講不出來，見宋天映面如土色，動也不動，神色十分可怖，不禁打了個寒顫。\r\n\r\n忽然背後傳來一聲冷笑，回身察看，卻是唐易。只聽他說道：「宋謀士，大難臨頭，還來私會你的小情人是麼？」 宋天映怒道：「唐莊主，宋天映在此，要剁要殺，是你我兩人之事。暗中下藥，傷及無辜，未免太不光明。」\r\n\r\n唐易愣了一下，望著半杯茶水，頓時了然，嘿嘿笑道：「她死了麼？那婆娘早該殺了。不想這次無心插柳，借情郎之手，殺那不忠不敬的淫婦，倒免了玷污我這口寶刀。」\r\n\r\n宋天映拔劍在身，氣得只想一個箭步上前，把唐易刺死在地。\r\n\r\n唐易道：「宋謀士，你這幾個月來做的事情，瞞得了莊客，瞞得了謀士，卻瞞不了本莊主。本莊主素來反對與晉議和，宋謀士改變不了唐家莊，便想投靠桓將軍，洩露機密，好讓晉軍輕而易舉地收拾唐家莊。我說的話不錯罷？」\r\n\r\n唐家莊之所以能在蜀地有舉足輕重的地位，有大半部份是來自宋天映的功勞。他自不希望見到唐家莊為晉軍所滅。然現任莊主暴虐無道，唐家莊日漸失去威信，蜀民怨聲載道。若非以晉軍之力擊敗莊主，還有甚麼辦法呢？ 宋天映思念及此，一時之間竟答不上話。\r\n\r\n唐易向身後兩個大漢使了眼神，從腰間抽出一口寶刀，似笑非笑道：「宋謀士，上劍！」\r\n\r\n宋天映愣了一下，忽地大喝一聲，挺劍上前，砍削斬劈，一口氣連攻十招，唐易在劍風之中縱橫來去，始終沒有反擊。待他第十一招劍身朝下之時，忽然舉刀猛劈，宋天映忽覺手腕沈了下去。這一招雖然刀法平平，勢道卻剛猛異常，不過連砍三刀，長劍已然脫手。\r\n\r\n宋天映心中一凜，只聽唐易道：「來來，咱們拳腳論高下！」 說時遲，那時快，才說了個拳字，右掌倏地揮出。宋天映閃避不及，兩手硬接。只覺對方掌力強勁，不由得退後好幾步，胸口隱隱作痛。\r\n\r\n宋天映心中憤怒異常，一招「火龍滾」向唐易劈去。唐易側身閃避，一掌從肩頭擦過，接著反手又是一招，越打越急，越鬥越險，各個招法快絕無倫。唐易使出的招數愈盡狠辣，似乎非置宋天映於死地，突然大喝一聲，橫身一躍，「直斬龍門」直劈而出，用了十足力量，宋天映也不退避，右手一轉，使盡全力，向前擊去，兩掌相交，砰然巨響，兩人都被震得站立不住。唐易退了兩步，宋天映卻向後跌了出去，撞上曲嫣。\r\n\r\n這時，曲嫣早與兩大漢拆了數十招。兩大漢的武藝平平，但身型龐大又以二敵一，曲嫣只能勉強支撐。不想宋天映突然撞了上來，一個分神，其中一大漢趁機一拳揮出，直中腹部。\r\n\r\n曲嫣跌坐在地，直瞪兩大漢，臉露殺機，騰地起身往前疾衝。那大漢自恃高大，竟不閃避，雙手護胸，欲與她來個硬碰硬，不料曲嫣到了面前竟然縮身，從腳下穿了出去，縱身躍起，抽出一把寒玉冰刀。刀刃出鞘，四周忽變得寒冷異常，刀身在燭光照射下，閃出幽藍的光影。曲嫣瞬時揮出，望著兩人劈頭便砍。咕咚一聲，兩個漢子已然身首異處。\r\n\r\n曲嫣往門邊一看，見唐易和宋天映又鬥了起來。僵持許久，忽見唐易衣袖裡面閃過一卷素色物事，大吃一驚，把手伸入懷中，竟空無一物。她顫抖著手，指向唐易，驚叫道：「你…你竟然偷了我爹爹的帛書！」\r\n\r\n宋天映心中詫然：「她爹爹的帛書？難道她就是崆峒武人之一？」 才一恍神，胸口便中了唐易用勁十足的一掌，仰身倒地。不一會兒，只覺胸口灼熱，緊接而來一陣刺痛，如上百枚金針刺入皮膚。他忙扯開衣袖，見胸口隱隱有一層黑氣。這一掌非同小可，竟是出了名的狠招「毒砂掌」。\r\n\r\n曲嫣乍見此招，往事斗然湧上心頭，臉色慘白，指著唐易道：「原來就是你！」 唐易道：「帛書在此，現在知道，也為時已晚了，嘿嘿！」\r\n\r\n原來在近一個月前，五位崆峒五人，包括曲氏父女和三個練武弟兄，路經吐谷渾，在荒漠一座岩洞內掘到一卷戰國帛書。五人打開一看，發現不得了，裡面竟繪出了寶藏武譜的所在，於是都興高采烈地要來中原尋寶。然而這幾人一路上各個心懷鬼胎，才來到與藏寶之處仍有千里之遙的蜀地，竟動起手來，自相殘殺，最後由曲氏父女奪得帛書。\r\n\r\n不料來到劍門蜀道，又遭近十個黑衣人埋伏。兩人擊退八九個黑衣人後，都是筋疲力竭，只剩下一個武功較高之人。曲老漢吃了這一仗後自知老命休矣，想後悔也為時已晚，向曲嫣道：「老子曾說過，芸芸眾生，生生死死，而不能得道上昇者，都是因一個『貪』字而起。貪求身外的有形萬物，不管得到與否，皆是大傷神氣，以致流浪生死，常沈於苦海之中，受苦受難。這卷帛書造成了崆峒武人之間的鬩牆，爹爹只求我唯一的女兒能夠好好活著，將此帛書送給將來要成大事之人，造福天下蒼生。」曲老漢將帛書遞給曲嫣，上前與那黑衣人鬥了起來。兩人拆了數招，卻見曲老漢胸口中掌，嘔出一口血，摔倒在地，動也不動，看似死了。那黑衣人正得意，蹲下身來便翻他衣袋，想找帛書。忽然曲老漢伸手抓住黑衣人，兩人在地翻滾扭打，一不注意，竟然翻身下崖！\r\n\r\n想到此處，曲嫣已是淚涕縱橫，全身癱軟。想當時自己孤身一人，又飢又渴，聽說蜀地唐家莊集賢納士，於是慕名而來，卻不知自己原來到了虎穴。曲嫣一肚子火氣，那料黑衣人竟然未死，恨不得立刻殺了他，一報殺父之仇！\r\n\r\n不知哪來的力氣，曲嫣突然橫身一躍，使了一套「奪命拳」猛擊唐易。唐易大吃一驚，見此套路來勢凌厲，不留活路，竟是難以硬擋，急著閃身相避。見曲嫣拔出寒玉冰刀揮來，他忙抽出七星刀相抵，兩刀相交，火花四濺，唐易暗暗心驚。曲嫣舉刀急砍猛斫，招招指向唐易各處死穴，而宋天映的劍也從背後襲來，自己只有防守的分。\r\n\r\n唐易見不是對頭，忙賣了個破綻，跳出圈外。一聲呼嘯，門外數十個士兵登時湧入，把宋天映和曲嫣包圍在內。兩人拚鬥多時，終究寡不敵眾，宋天映也因此毒發更快，只覺一陣暈眩，當場撲倒在地，昏死過去。好幾個士兵見機不可失，刀劍鎗棍一併戳來！\r\n\r\n突然間房內嗡嗡作響，數十把飛刀破窗而入，好幾名士兵都被戳翻在地。眾人驚愕間，只見一書生打扮的青年，抱著一個身虛體弱的女子，從窗戶躍將近來。卻是凌公子與景涵。\r\n\r\n唐易乾笑一聲，說道：「好精準的身手。凌兄想必也是來取帛書的罷？」凌公子道：「唐兄料事如神。在下向來不愛管事，但為了帛書和桓將軍的擁護者，不想管也得管了。」唐易道：「凌兄的意思是？」凌公子指著景涵道：「還請唐兄另賜解藥。」\r\n\r\n唐易道：「那杯茶早是為了讓中毒之人必死無疑，所以摻入的毒並沒有解藥。這婆娘死不死也只是早晚的問題。」此時景涵已悠悠醒轉，聽了唐易一言，心中涼了大半。 凌公子愣了半晌，說道：「此話當真？」唐易道：「凌兄可曾聽本莊主有過半句虛言？」凌公子心想此話不錯，一時間默然不語。\r\n\r\n只見景涵起身，幽幽地道：「唐莊主，容我和你來一場比試，在刀劍上分高下。」唐易道：「輸了便怎樣？」景涵道：「我若輸了，任憑你處置；你若輸了，立刻歸還帛書，放大夥離開。」\r\n\r\n唐易嘿嘿一笑，心想你這娘兒死到臨頭還敢跟老子比試。老子恐怕只消兩三招，不待你毒性發作，馬上置你於死地。當下也不說大話，抽出寶刀站在房中央，說道：「來罷！」將刀一晃，欲待進招，景涵的長劍已劈頭刺到。唐易連忙側頭，又驚又怒，想道若不是老子閃得快，這顆頭豈不是要給她劈成兩半？ 當下邁開腳步，將自己最為得意的唐家刀法施展出來。但見刀光閃閃，劍影飛旋，兩人聚精會神，互不相讓，越打越烈。\r\n\r\n拚鬥多時，唐易見景涵如此倔強，不由得不耐煩起來，心想這番鬥得沒完沒了，怎還有力氣去收拾另外三個反賊？ 接連使出的刀法愈是很辣，盡是殺機。 他卻沒料到，景涵此時心裡所想的，便是：「左右是個死，倒不如與敵人同歸於盡！」\r\n\r\n時間一久，景涵體力逐漸不支，面對唐易的刀法也愈漸不敵。唐易看在眼裡，心裡冷笑，提步上前，突然大喝一聲，刀鋒一轉，往她腹中刺去。不料景涵不閃不架，反而撲身向前。但見刀鋒沒入腹中，景涵同時舉劍望唐易頸中一抹。唐易做夢也想不到會發生這等事，寶刀還不及拔出，頸中的血卻先濺了出來。他低吼一聲，拔出寶刀，使盡最後一股力氣，直狠狠地望景涵脖頸，橫劈而去。\r\n\r\n景涵受傷甚重，彎刀揮來時，竟無力閃避，當下心中一寒。霎時間，卻見唐易死瞪雙眼，寶刀停落半空，全身僵直如木。景涵正自錯愕，忽見唐易似樹木一般，直挺挺地倒下，磅地一聲，氣絕在地，後心插著一把凌公子的飛刀，刀身沒入直至刀柄。\r\n\r\n正所謂樹倒猢猻散，那些僥倖活命的士兵，見莊主被殺，都如無頭蒼蠅般慌忙逃去了。凌公子和曲嫣抱起景涵到床上躺下，但見她氣若游絲，面無血色。掙扎許久，才無力地問道：「宋大哥怎樣了？」凌公子道：「為了提防唐易的毒砂掌，我身邊早備有解藥。宋天映不會有事的。」 景涵安然一笑，闔上雙眼。 凌公子和曲焉靜靜目送景涵含笑而逝。\r\n\r\n良久，曲嫣將帛書遞與凌公子，說道：「這帛書給你，希望桓將軍之後能夠成就大業，讓人民過更好的日子。」她慘然一笑，轉身望窗外，飄然而去。凌公子呆愣半晌，道：「你不跟我們一起走麼？」站起身來，跟著追出窗外。\r\n\r\n過了一盞茶時分，宋天映漸漸醒轉，見原本雕闌玉砌、富麗堂皇的玉門豪房，經一場惡鬥變得慘不忍睹、凌亂不堪，不禁慨然長嘆。忽瞥見床上躺著一人，仔細一看，卻不是景涵是誰？ 他湊身過去，見她臉色慘白，渾身僵硬，顯是死去多時。宋天映簡直不敢相信自己的眼睛，望著她的笑容，忽然悲從中來，伏在景涵身上失聲痛哭…\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n曉月墜，宿雲微，又是一天的開始。宋天映獨步後園，凝視著一座小小石墳，暗自嘆氣。\r\n\r\n晨風拂來，他不覺打了個寒顫。龍門山的晨間孤寂蕭條，恰和自己的心相輝映。萬物會隨著太陽的升起而再度甦醒，然而，自己心中的那顆太陽呢？ 思念及此，原本泛紅的眼眶，更盈滿了淚珠。\r\n\r\n忽聽得身後一人說道：「準備好了麼？」 宋天映擦乾淚水，回過身來，卻是凌公子，牽著兩匹駿馬。\r\n\r\n宋天映道：「曲嫣不跟我們走麼？」 凌公子道：「曲嫣只怕已不在塵世。」他頓了一下，道：「昨日在荒山野地中，途經一座寺院，她進去之後，便不再出來了。」兩人沈默，久久不語。\r\n\r\n好一會兒，凌公子才黯然道：「昨天晚上真的很遺憾。」 宋天映望著石墳，淡淡說道：「昨夜沈睡時，我夢見了一季的花落。那花兒容姿絕麗，嬌美不可玩物。只可惜凋零之後，便不復綻放了。」\r\n凌公子微微苦笑，從懷裡掏出帛書看了看，道：「我們走罷。」\r\n\r\n兩人躍上馬背，迎著東升的陽光達達而行。宋天映掉落在石墳上的淚珠，反射著旭日光芒，化作縷縷晴絲，消失在無邊無際的遠方。\r\n\r\n------------------ END

話說福州東南一側有座南山，其山勢崎嶇，嵬嶷嶢屼。時見筆峰挺立，曲澗深沈。偶有白練般的流水倒掛其間，形成瀑布，雪浪紛飛，雲霧終年繚繞其間，因此傳為仙人聚集修道之所。又其山型如鳳凰展翼，故亦名為鳳凰山。\r\n\r\n  鳳凰山中有座古廟，廟內供的神像藍藍綠綠，各個橫眉豎目、瞪眼獰笑，做手舞足道之狀，大大小小加起來一共百來個。此廟所在山頭道路險阻，人跡少至，經歷了幾十年光景，更因年久失修，而致廟宇破廢，神像毀壞。山下居民更說此地常有怪風，每當三五之夜，便會看見幽幽的藍火在樹林間飄忽，聽見似人非人的怒吼咆哮之聲在山谷間回盪，因此紛紛傳說此地鬧鬼。\r\n\r\n  卻說鳳凰山腳下有間鹿鳴書院，班有十人，裡頭有位韓生，年約弱冠，長得白白淨淨，貌似姑娘，又因其生性膽小，同窗們都戲稱他「兔兒郎」。一日，韓生如往常至書院，尋了自家桌椅，坐身解開行囊，想取書預習。不料才剛解出了個小縫，裡頭忽然鑽出一條青蛇，迫不及待地想要破囊而出。韓生驚叫一聲，騰地從椅上躍起，右手一揮，連囊帶蛇，滾溜溜地飛出窗外。韓生驚魂未定，後退一步，竟絆到了後方人的桌腳，一個踉蹌，往後便倒，背心壓人，屁股碾桌，直把桌上的茶水撞得灑了一地，登時惹出了一陣哄堂大笑。有人笑得涕淚滿面，有人則樂得滾倒在地，喧鬧之聲久久不絕。\r\n\r\n  韓生漲紅了臉，深覺羞愧難當，一股火氣從腔子裡湧出，再也按捺不住，突然一拍桌子，直身站起，大聲說道：「你們覺得放小蛇到袋子裡嚇唬別人，好有趣麼？若這蛇有毒，被咬了豈不當場斃命？」一小眼書生站起來叫道：「害怕便是害怕，你哪來那麼多藉口圓你謊子？」其他人也跟著起鬨道：「膽小鬼，兔兒郎，東怕西怕叫娘娘；娘娘說，兔兒郎，南吵北吵少嚷嚷！」\r\n\r\n  韓生指著眾書生，大聲叫道：「你們…你們狗咬呂洞賓，不識好人心！若不是我丟出青蛇，牠發威起來，只怕你們各個遭殃，如今卻反過來笑我膽小，你說這還有天理麼？」眾人聞言，登時又是一陣嘻笑怒罵之聲。忽然間，有一身材矮胖的書生走向前來，向韓生道：「你口口聲稱自己並不膽小，咱們各個也並非沒生眼睛，哪一個肯相信？你若有種，圓夜之日，自個兒一人到山上那破廟裡頭走一遭，咱們親眼看著，那可就沒話說啦！」韓生熱血沸騰，想也不想，當下一口答應。\r\n\r\n  是月十五日之夜，眾書生吵吵嚷嚷，都擁著韓生上山。韓生左顧右盼，但見月黑風高，樹影搖曳，漆黑的林子裡，時有晚重唧唧，禽獸幽鳴。偶爾不知從哪刮起幾陣強風，直把樹葉搖得窸窣作響，好似幽靈竊笑，女鬼低泣。韓生心裡碰碰亂跳，於自己逞一時之氣好生後悔。但自己此時若臨陣脫逃，那當真比原先沒有答應他們還要顯得窩囊。沒奈何，只得硬著頭皮繼續上山。\r\n\r\n  過了一時辰，眾人終於來到廟院之外。此時正值子時，頭頂上的月光掩映，被飄來的雲霧逐漸遮住。眾人目不見物，點起了火把，見那門邊圍欄損壞，無法上鎖，於是輕推而入，來到中庭。矮胖書生遞了一袋米給韓生，說道：「你進到裡頭，把所到之處用米灑過，否則誰也不知你會不會一直躲在門口，等時間到了再出來呼隆我們？」\r\n\r\n  韓生勉強接過，繃緊了身子，一步一步緩緩地向廟門移動。才剛行至門口，那門忽然嘎地一聲打開了。韓生臉色發白，兩手緊握著胸前的護身符，念幾聲阿密陀佛，才壯起膽子，跨門入內。\r\n\r\n  舉火把望室內一照，只見塵沙蓋地，蛛絲滿佈，每走一步，便有許多沙土遊絲隨風飄揚。火光映著兩側神像，在蝕壁上微微顫動，大大小小藍藍綠綠的神像，瞪大雙目，咧嘴而笑，面貌猙獰已極，似是隨時都要跳出來吃人一般。韓生一見駭然，急忙趨步入室，只想灑著些米便快快出來。\r\n\r\n  韓生穿過重重倒塌的神龕與佛桌，還有幾尊成泥的觀音像，來到了內室。忽然聽見隱隱的腳步聲，參差著口齒咀嚼之聲。韓生聽得寒毛直豎，想要掉頭離去，一時間竟迷失了方向。慢行間，走進一室，火光照處，映入眼簾的竟是一團綠色毛物，有兩人寬高，生了三顆碗口大的眼睛，和兩隻人手臂一般長，自下而上的銀白色獠牙，嘴裡兀自咀嚼著一隻人腿，身旁有一件被扯個粉碎的僧袍。\r\n\r\n  韓生嚇得一顆心險些跳將出腔子來，整個身子不由得望後直退，誰知撞上了身後一只鐵碗，鐵碗墜地，發出哐噹好大一聲響。那妖驚聞，立時抬起頭來，瞪著三隻亮晃晃的眼睛，蠢蠢欲動。韓生嚇得魂飛魄散，牙齒嘎嘎作響，想逃跑，腳卻不聽使喚，反而撲倒在地。那妖見了，直身站起，仰面咆哮，聲音極盡刺耳難聽，張著血盆大口，便望韓生疾撲過去。韓生心裡一涼，縮緊著身子，幾乎要暈去。不料那怪還未觸及韓生，韓生胸口間竟出現了一道光亮，炫目奪人，那怪霎時間像被閃電電到一般，驚吼一聲，被彈得向外飛出數丈，又在地滾了數圈，才手腳並立，藏頭縮頸，慌慌張張地逃了。\r\n\r\n  韓生驚魂未定，見那怪抱頭逃竄，更是驚愕不已，左手伸入領口之中，取出一塊環形翠玉，玉面上有一長串符咒沿際而刻，竟就是適才救了自己一命的護身符！韓生手撫翠玉，暗暗慶幸，此時卻不敢多待，隨意將米一灑，匆匆而出。\r\n\r\n  卻說院外眾書生也聽聞怪物咆哮之聲，都擠成一團咯咯發顫，忽見韓生趨步而出，臉色慘白，忙迎了上來，過問情況。韓生將廟裡所見之事一一說了，又加油添醋一番，將自己勇猛對敵的事跡，說得活靈活現。眾書生們雖然半信半疑，卻沒人趕再踏進那廟門一步。\r\n\r\n  回家後，韓生點起油燈，獨自呆坐床上，想起今夜險些被妖怪吃掉，仍自心有餘悸。發愣間，忽聽得臥房中有悉悉簌簌的聲響，循聲望去，見自己的背袋竟在蠕蠕而動！韓生驚叫一聲，忙捧起矮几上的翡翠瓶，緩緩靠近，心想如若是妖魅鬼怪之類，便立刻砸了它們。卻見那袋口乍開，裡頭蹦出了一隻手掌大小的獵犬，毛色白栗相間，搖著尾巴蹦跳奔走，活潑雀躍，甚是可愛。韓生用手輕撫，覺其毛輕軟綿密，把玩了一會兒，心想：「如今同窗們不放青蛇到我背袋，反放了一隻可愛的狗兒，應是佩服我這次勇氣可嘉罷？」得意了半晌，只覺睡意上湧，把小獵犬藏入盒子裡，先自睡了。\r\n\r\n  此後韓生每日餵食，呵護甚厚。偶見鄰家女孩路經其門，便向狗兒訴其愛慕之意；時被同窗嬉鬧惡整，便與狗兒洩其煩悶之念；每當讀書有感而發，便與狗兒論其見解，種種心事，無所不訴。那犬甚有靈性，當韓生說話，每每注視其目，偶以叫聲或擺尾相應。\r\n\r\n  數月過去，適逢九九重陽之節，家家戶戶插茱萸、焚艾草、飲雄黃。韓生好藏美酒，是日取了兩大甕，一尊盛菊花、一瓶攬雄黃，獨坐中庭，舉杯啜飲。暢飲之際，臥在韓生腿上的小獵犬忽然抬頭，一個騰身，竟跳進了裝滿雄黃酒的大甕之中。韓生大驚，忙要去捉，卻聽甕中傳來連續不斷，呼嚕呼嚕之聲，緊接著甕身碎裂，成了十七廿八塊。只見裡頭一團栗色毛物逐漸長大，直身立起，竟只比韓生矮一個頭。韓生見了驚異更甚，原來自己養的獵犬喝了雄黃酒後，竟變成了一隻怪物！韓生嚇得一個踉蹌翻倒在地，左手忙從領口取出翠玉，對著那犬怪大聲叫道：「妖怪別過來！」\r\n\r\n  那犬怪瞟了翠玉一眼，乾笑道：「你那玉，只對二流妖怪有功效，對老子卻是無用！怎麼，你餵了老子這麼多月了，難道還怕俺忘恩負義，對你不利麼？」韓生聞言，心裡鬆了一口氣。只聽那犬怪道：「待我先取你家東西用用。」於是拆掉窗帘，念了串咒語，那窗帘霎時變作一件白羅袍，又取一盞酒器，道了聲「變」，變成了一頂官帽，穿戴於身。\r\n\r\n  韓生在旁看傻了，忍不住問道：「你倒底是何方神聖？」犬怪道：「甚麼神聖倒不敢當，俺上輩子本為捉妖道士，只因地藏王菩薩坐騎下凡，誤殺了牠，因此被懲下輩子投狗胎。如今我雖為狗，但行業仍舊，神妖之界皆稱我犬判官。我本有一為僧的主人，那日至鳳凰山中古廟捉妖，不幸被妖吃了。唉，被吃了倒好，那人總把俺當作畜生看待。」牠停下看韓生的表情，嘿了一聲道：「你別看俺生成這副模樣，俺的心裡和你們一般，也是有自尊地！」\r\n\r\n  韓生道：「既有自尊，幹啥子還變成一隻小狗，跟我回家，又騙了我那麼多心事？這可一點兒也不好玩。」犬判官呸了一聲道：「你以為俺閒著沒事，變成小狗來聽你說鬼話麼？老子煩都煩死了！只因那日俺隨僧捉妖，一時大意，被妖吹了一口臭氣，不及抵擋，再起來時，就變成那副德性啦！幸得你及時來到廟裡，用護身符驅逐了妖怪，我趁機翻入你背袋，這才留得一條命在。直至今日，我飲了雄黃，才得將體內妖氣驅散，變回本來面目。」韓生驚嘬嘬地聽著，幾乎難以置信，一時間竟不知該說甚麼。\r\n\r\n  卻聽犬判官道：「如今俺回復原身，本該要走，但看在你救過俺一命的份上，你既有難，俺便應當留下相助，待事一成，咱們後會無期。」韓生大惑不解道：「我這好端端的，你卻說我有甚麼難了？」犬判官舉目四顧，搖頭道：「我瞧你這房屋四周，近日青氣頗重，你吸入那些青氣，臉色日漸難看，只怕有青毛獅精，這幾日就要上門尋仇了。」韓生吃驚道：「獅精？我這輩子連獅子都不曾見過，牠如何無緣無故，上門找我尋仇？」犬判官道：「這我就不知道了。」只見牠從口中吐出一只牙齒般的小葫蘆，兩手接住時，已變成手掌大小，走出屋外，於房屋四角灑了符水。韓生卻見屋內之氣逐漸清晰，直至回復原本的清亮潔淨，這才發掘屋內青氣滯留，竟已有好一段時間了。韓生見狀，不由得駭然失色。\r\n\r\n  犬判官向韓生道：「你先過來讓我瞧瞧。」韓生依示向前。犬判官脫去其紗羅帽，一手置其頭頂，口中念了一串咒語。韓生登覺頭暈目眩，雖然人仍站立於中庭之上，其靈魂意識竟似墜入了地心深處，另一個時空之中。韓生第一幕所見之景，乃是一大城門，上頭刻著「平城」兩大字，其身游移入城，穿梭於熙來攘往的人群之中，人們交談所用之語，自己竟全然不解。穿過人群，映入眼簾的是一座寺院，牌坊上寫著「聖山寺」。\r\n\r\n  寺廟裡頭火光烈焰，熊熊激燃，閃得幾乎讓人睜不開眼睛。忽然廟門口閃出一隻屋檐高度的火獅，張著大焱血口，一個縱身，直望韓生飛撲而來。韓生失聲驚叫，頓覺身後一股吸力將自己望後直拉，倒著身子，扯著穿過人群之間。那火獅於空中騰飛，緊跟韓生，愈漸接近。韓生被拉向後，直出城門，兩門關上，將火獅鎖於其內。韓生但覺頭昏眼花，其魂不斷向上騰昇，直至與己軀殼合而為一，這才回到了中庭之上。\r\n\r\n  韓生嚇得幾乎要昏厥，勉強扶住犬判官的手，顫抖著問道：「我適才所見，究竟是甚麼事兒？」犬判官道：「你見了這幾幕場景，想來應知道了大概。平城乃北魏的首都，北魏初期，城內之人多用鮮卑語交談，因此時間距今，至少也有五百年之久。你與青毛獅結怨，可追溯至你前七世之時。那時北魏太武帝在位，你在朝廷為官，專責此期的毀佛行動。傳說成安有座聖山寺，十分靈驗，你親自率人拆毀此廟，摔神倒佛，並砸爛數頭石獅。而青毛石獅是裡頭唯一僥倖生存的。青毛石獅眼見神佛搗毀、石獅碎散，立誓要報仇，因此變成獅子，隱居山中修煉，並伺機尋仇。」\r\n\r\n  韓生聞言，面色發白，顫聲道：「既是前七世的仇怨，當時便應了結，如何拖到現在，還要尋我麻煩？」犬判官道：「話說妖魔須有五百年道行方能成精，你那寶玉護身符，防得妖卻防不得精。那獅妖修煉，還未成精，而你此後幾世有寶玉護身，因此僥倖避掉了災難。不幸到你這世，獅妖恰好修道圓滿，順利成精，你便有寶玉，再也難防牠向你尋仇。」韓生聽了急道：「造你這般說，我卻如何是好？如何是好？」犬判官淡然道：「你且莫管，山人自有妙計。」\r\n\r\n  六日之後，十五圓夜，窗外皓月當空，銀河耿耿，映著疏枝矮葉，隨風搖曳。臥房之內，油燈熒然，偶被夜風吹得微微發顫。犬判官低聲囑咐韓生，韓生點頭答允，隨即將油燈吹滅，室內登時一片漆黑。\r\n  至三更初響，忽有腳踏殘枝之聲，小院內的蛙聲蟲鳴頓時停了下來，隱隱地傳來一陣低吼。月光下一道青影閃過，簾幕驚風乍起，青毛獅精一對圓眼閃著黃光，\r\n\r\n  在臥房之內一眨一眨，緩緩游移至韓生床榻跟前，沈著嗓子道：「骯臟狗官！五百年前的孽障，莫以為死了轉世，就能僥倖逃過，如今爺爺上門向你討這筆帳，只教你求生不得，求死不能，永世沒法超生！」見那韓生緊縮在被窩裡頭，動也不動，殺機大起，登時大吼一聲，飛撲床前，一張血口望著韓生，連人帶被，便要撕成兩半。不料那被飛濺起來之時，不見一張床的血肉橫飛，卻是一袋子的臭泥熏天！青毛獅精又驚又怒，回過頭去，卻見一隻似犬非犬的怪物立於窗邊，一對圓溜溜的雙目映著月光，炯炯閃爍。\r\n\r\n  青毛獅精譏笑道：「我道是誰，原來是條狗腿子。奴才護主，爺爺趕你不走，多殺了你這條一文不值的狗命，只是玷污了我一口寶刀！」犬判官罵道：「我把你個潑毛團，當真有眼無珠！你道自己修煉了五百年道行，便是天下無敵麼？你快上前吃老子一劍，只教你頃刻化為虀粉！」瞬時騰雲駕霧，來到了寂院半空，青毛獅精駕青雲，從後趕上。\r\n\r\n  只見青毛獅精自鼻中吐出一道青氣，至手中時，已幻化成一口寒氣逼人的寶刀；同時間，犬判官也從口中吐出一道白氣，握於手中，揮一揮，變成了一把銀光鋒爍的寶劍。霎時間，但見四周寒風颯颯，怪霧森森，刀劍交舞，一青一白，快若流星趕月，電光疾閃，鋪天蓋地，籠罩了整座庭院。鋒刀利劍幻化無邊，一會兒似猛虎伏岸，一會兒又如蛟龍翻騰，環繞飛旋，情勢兇險已極。\r\n\r\n  青毛獅精見犬判官實力不在己下，於是賣弄神通，吐出一口火焰。細見那火焰卻也生了眼睛鼻子嘴巴，咧嘴獰笑，望犬判官，照面飛來。犬判官揮舞長劍，劍尖指向烈燄，繞圓而轉，霎時間成了一道銀白色的水輪，將那火焰捲將進去。劍尖再逆轉時，一隻水龍從中疾游而出，霎時間，已將青毛獅精團團圍住。青毛獅精提起火刀，使起平生之力苦苦奮鬥，然有句話道：「抽刀斷水水更流」無論牠如何橫砍縱砍、直砍側砍，於這水龍自是渾然無用。\r\n\r\n  且說修煉五百成精，再修五百而成仙。青毛獅精此時方知，眼前這似犬非犬之物，恐怕只消再練個十年，便能飛天而成仙。此時發覺，身子各處早給抓出了數道傷痕。青毛獅精思念及此，已然心怯，收了寶刀，放開拳頭，搖身一變，變作一隻野鴿兒，抖開翅，慌慌張張飛入暗空之中。犬判官睜眼觀看，收回水龍，抖擻精神，變作一隻大梟，沖天而上，張嘴去銜。青毛獅精一個俯衝，變成一匹快馬，馳騁於山林之中。犬判官直衝而下，變作一頭獵豹，緊緊直追。青毛獅精驚慌失措，見樹林深處，隱隱有座古廟，情急間，翻枝踏葉，變作一隻貓兒，翻牆入內，躲了起來。\r\n\r\n  犬判官認得此廟，提高警覺，入廟門，現原身，四顧張望，但見四周死氣沈沈地，一片闃靜，即便是自己微微的呼吸聲，都能聽得一清二楚。犬判官屏氣凝神，提劍護身，但見殘壁朽架之上，所刻所擺的神像，或怒或笑，做攻擊之狀，與前次所見幾乎相同，並無異狀。再走一陣，穿過迴廊，忽見眼前立著兩道門。犬判官登覺有異，心道：「卻是怪哉，前次來時，俺倒不記得這裡有兩道門？」眼觀二門，但見左邊一門兩側與上頭雕工精細，有若一頭猛獅，張大了口，蓄勢待發。犬判官瞧得戰戰兢兢，往旁一看，卻見那門邊的柱子，正淌著血呢！\r\n\r\n  犬判官故作驚訝道：「哎喲！俺還不曾見過柱子被搗了，還會流血哩！俺不如也砸了這道門，瞧它滴不滴血？」話未說完，但聞一陣震耳欲聾的怒吼之聲，那左門轟隆隆地震動起來，門上門下霎時間各出現了一排鋒利獠牙，猛力合將起來。倘若犬判官再前進個一步，頭與身必定當場裂成兩半。但見那石刻獅子自牆中跳出，冒在空中不見了。左門與雕刻霎時間退回成一座殘垣頹壁，果然是青毛獅精所變。\r\n\r\n  正瞧間，身後忽然一股勁風，直望後腦襲來。犬判官急急向旁滾了一圈，但見四周空無一物，哪裡還有青毛獅精的蹤影？犬判官罵道：「臭毛團，你道使了個隱身法，老子便找不到你了麼？俺可沒閑功夫，與你玩這些小孩兒的把戲！這會兒只教你現出原身罷！」口裡一吐，吐出一只葫蘆，把葫蘆裡頭的符水望空中一灑，但見頭頂忽然一頭石獅墜將下來，哐噹撞地，動也不動。\r\n\r\n  青毛獅精本為一具靈氣的石獅修煉而成，如今現出原形，靈氣鎖於石體之中，饒牠如何憤怒慾狂，卻遲遲不得動彈。犬判官噓了一口氣，掏出一袋手掌大小的皮囊，將石獅裝了進去。即便石獅與犬判官一般大小，這囊袋卻如無底洞似地，裝載自如。\r\n\r\n  待要離去，忽聽身後嘓嘓一聲，只見一隻全身綠色的三眼妖怪，正鄧鄧呆呆地盯著自己。犬判官嘿一聲道：「老冤家，老子上次沒有捉著你，如今你也逃不掉啦！」但見那怪低伏於地，吸氣吸得全身圓鼓鼓地，突然間一吐妖氣，猛往犬判官面門吹來。\r\n\r\n  犬判官此次也不大意，抽出寶劍在身前揮舞，形成了一道白色密網將妖氣包著，寶劍瞬時變成了棍棒，兩手握著，順勢望那白網一揮，網內妖氣便朝那怪直吹而去。又聽嘓嘓一聲，那怪竟變成了一隻癩蝦膜！犬判官心裡嘀咕：「這蝦膜還未成精便煉成這般法術，若成精了，豈不危害人們更甚？」手一揮，也收在皮囊裡頭，跨步走出了古廟。\r\n\r\n  古廟之外，曉風拂面，偶有鳥囀清音，盪漾耳際。此時天剛破曉，遠處蒼山散著金光。鳳凰山天邊，仍掛著一輪逐漸淡去的月。犬判官遙望景色，心頭慨嘆道：「想想這獅，倒也是有情有義之輩。家園被焚，族人被殺，僥倖逃亡，豈有徒哀傷而不報仇之理？若換作我，定也會這麼做。而今捉了牠，卻又該如何處置是好？」沈思間，但見空宵之際，忽然有金光萬道，伴著滾滾紅霓，一朵五色祥雲自遠而至，後有千條瑞氣迆邐漫延。犬判官愣愣凝視，只覺恍若夢中，直至祥雲停落眼前，這才看清駕雲之人，竟是大願地藏王菩薩。\r\n\r\n  犬判官見了，忙躬身行禮。菩薩道：「犬判官，別來無恙？聽說你虜獲一隻獅精，卻打算如何處置？」犬判官道：「卑職瞧這獅精，試圖傷人，乃因身負血海之仇所致，正是情有可原，望其能從輕發落。」菩薩點頭道：「既如此說，你將牠放出來罷。自我失了坐騎以後，再也不曾遇著如此奇才。」犬判官會意，將石獅自皮囊放出。菩薩手持金珠，輕輕一彈，化作閃閃金粉，灑落石獅身上。\r\n\r\n  只見石身逐漸碎裂，裡頭躍出了一頭健壯的金獅，凜然而立，顧盼煒如。犬判官見狀，心下驚歎不已。那金獅行至菩薩跟前，恭恭敬敬地蹲身在地，菩薩套了一金箍於其頭頂，翻身而上，向犬判官點了點頭，駕著金獅，飛昇上天，漸漸地變成一道金光，瞬間消失在晨空宿雲之間。犬判官淡淡一笑，縱起雲頭，飄飛而去。\r\n\r\n  卻說韓生正襟危坐，一整夜焦慮難眠，直至旭日東昇，見犬判官踏雲歸來，這才大鬆口氣，笑臉相迎。只聞犬判官說道：「青毛獅精一事已解決，如今俺該做的也做了，俺們就此道別罷。」韓生聞言，依依不捨，一再挽留。犬判官沈默半晌，四顧張望，目光停留在一把高掛於牆壁上的寶劍，緩緩說道：「你俺既然有緣，今日俺便傳與你一套劍法，盼你日後好好練習，替這世間剷除邪惡，俺們也不枉相識一場。」韓生聞言喜不自勝，趕緊跪地拜其為師。\r\n\r\n  犬判官取下寶劍，說道：「此劍稱作斬妖劍，乃稀世珍寶。只因沾染了世俗之氣，而失其鋒芒，暗淡無光。」語畢，取了鍋碗點了火，注入符咒與神水，將劍放入煮夠多時，只見劍身發光奪目，絢彩逼人，果然是把好劍。犬判官道：「這世上仍有許多邪妖厲鬼，到處危害肆虐，俺授你劍法，但盼你心地光明，救困扶危，進而匡時濟俗。」韓生連聲答應。\r\n\r\n  犬判官將一套劍法完整使出，並受其劍訣。雖然韓生看似一膽小懦弱的書呆子，但練起劍來極有天賦且專心十足，犬判官偶從旁指點，不過花了三天時間，便將一路劍法練個精熟。犬判官又授其內功心法之訣，確認韓生記熟後，遞給他一袋皮囊道：「劍法、內功，你已捉到訣竅。持續修煉，待功力已成，你便可將天地間妖魔，裝入皮囊之中。你若有心，俺們十年後青城山再見，如今時間已到，但願後會有期。」韓生連連稱謝，又向犬判官拜了好幾拜。犬判官駕祥雲，乘瑞風，飄然離去。\r\n\r\n  韓生此後更加專心修煉，若干年後，傳言其在東南一帶大有作為，專替人斬妖除魔，且不收一文錢。韓生遊歷在外，如此數年，某日上了青城山後，便再也無人聽得他的消息了。\r\n\r\n`\r\n\r\n;\r\n\r\nclass Wolf extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n\r\n

Adding friendly information</strong><br />\r\n                  <p className=\"indent\">One of the main features of the app is to have users build up information together. Many places are lacked of revelent information. Uses can offer information they know just within a few steps. The more information users offer, the more complete information will be on the app.</p>\r\n                  <strong>c. Reporting unfriendly facilities</strong><br />\r\n                  <p className=\"indent\">If the users encounter unfriendly circumstances, they will be encouraged to report the unfriendly information through our app in an easy way. It starts from selecting facilities, adding loca- tions, write down problems, and taking photos.

Information Pages</strong><br />\r\n                  <p className=\"indent\">The information page presents not only friendly information but also unfriendly information. They will be seperated by the color green and red.</p>\r\n                  <p className=\"indent\">After tapping on a specific photo, several cards pop up, displaying information of the specific facility. It can be photos from different perpective, also of different descriptions.</p>\r\n                  <strong>2. Reporting Unfriendly Facilities</strong><br />\r\n                  <p className=\"indent\">Attractions and Buildings - The form of reporting unfriendly facilities of attractions and buildings is just like the way users add friendly information to our app. Whether to report unfriendly information to 1999 can be decided by the user, while some users may consider the unfriendly information is not so serious to be reported to 1999.</p>\r\n                  <strong>3. Workflow of the Attraction Feedback Card</strong><br />\r\n                  <p className=\"indent\">After user testing, we found out that the feedback card might sometimes be seen after the user get back home rather than being at the spot. If the user has left the place, they are only able to rate the accessibility and like of the place without offering the related information. Thus, we discussed that the card should disappear if the user has left the place.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n          </WhiteBlock>\r\n          <WhiteBlock>\r\n                <div className=\"passage passage_content\">\r\n                  <Progress  />\r\n                  <h4 className=\"small_topic\">1.

Back into ver.1, we should add a “Building information” function into the tab bar at the bottom of the app. After entering the “Building information” page, the users can choose whether it is an unfriendly facility in a building or a road obstacle. <br /><br />\r\n                  c.

Among disables, seventy percent of them rely on wheelchairs. In Taiwan, government built up several accessible facilities, yet, not all of them are “accessible”. Wheelchair users desire to go outdoors just like normal people do, but there are still lots of preparation to do beforehand.<br /> Due the scattered information that is difficult to search, and the discovery of the facilities which are far beyond their expectations after reaching the place, wheelchair users find great inconve- nience and anxiety while heading to unfamiliar places. <br />Thus, we expect to build up a platform which allows users to construct an accessible map through their perspectives. Every wheelchair users has their own familiar accessible map. If we put those maps together, a complete accessible map can be constructed, which will benefit every one of them.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n          </WhiteBlock>\r\n          <WhiteBlock>\r\n                <div className=\"passage passage_content\">\r\n                    <strong>Three Main Functions of WellGO include:</strong><br /><br />\r\n                    <strong>1.
